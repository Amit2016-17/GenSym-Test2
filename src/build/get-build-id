#   This script takes one argument, which is a path to delta.lisp.  It just
# echoes its results to standard output, which will be the build ID, such as
# 51r5-CC02.  Because the build ID gets spliced into filenames and so forth, the
# error messages don't contain spaces.  Hopefully anyone looking at the results
# of such filenames would immediately discover the problem when their filename
# had the error message instead.
#   The sed line below was lifted directly from supervisor and works.  If
# you have to figure out exactly what it does, please document it here.
