# This script reads the CVS commitlog searching for groups of lines delimited
# by
#   @begin(public-announcement)
# and
#   @end(public-announcement)
# If no filename is present each group is printed to the file
# /home/ab/promote.log (so the user must be ab).  If a filename is present, 
# the groups are printed to that file.
# The @begin lines are replaced by an empty line to provide spacing. The
# @end lines are deleted.
# It is assumed that $CVSROOT is set appropriately.
