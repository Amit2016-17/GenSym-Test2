<p>This example mostly uses default properties; it only specifies the
host and port on which G2 is running to be localhost and 1111,
respectively.

<!-- Users must have the Telewindows ActiveX Control installed on their machine
     for the following to work.  You received a cabinet file, TwControl.cab,
     with G2, which will allow users' browsers to automatically download and
     install the control.  To accomplish this, you need to install the cabinet
     file on your intranet web server, and modify the example URL shown below
     to reflect the location where you installed it.

<P>Notes/requirements:

<ul>

<li>In this example, the Telewindows ActiveX control connects to host
"<b>localhost</b>" at TCP/IP port <b>1111</b>.  Before running this
example, you should run G2 on the same computer as your browser.  Make
sure G2 uses port 1111. You can see which port is being used by
running the command <i>Main Menu</i> -> <i>Miscellany</i> ->
<i>Network Info</i>.  Alternatively, change the host and port settings
specified in the VB Script code in this HTML document so that they
specify the desired G2 host and port.

<li>No particular KB is required or expected for this example.

<li>Here is the VB Script code used for this example:<br>
  <pre>
  &lt;OBJECT CLASSID="clsid:EC99E4EE-F5F1-4323-9829-06E9B0AFB934"
          ID=WorkstationView HEIGHT=500 WIDTH=700 HSPACE=85
          <b>codebase="http://download.example.com/gensym/TwControl.cab#Version=8,3,128,1"></b>
  &lt;/OBJECT>
  &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=VBScript>
  WorkstationView.LaunchHost = "<b>localhost</b>"
  WorkstationView.LaunchPort = "<b>1111</b>"
  WorkstationView.LaunchBackground = "pale-goldenrod"
  WorkstationView.ConnectToG2()
  &lt;/SCRIPT></pre>

<li>The codebase for the control object specifies a fictitious URL.  Customers
are encouraged to set up their own internal download locations on their internal
("intranet") web or FTP servers.

<li>This example mostly uses default properties; it only specifies the
<b>host</b> and <b>port</b> on which G2 is running.  Even those properties
are not necessary, but are provided here to make it clear how to
customize these settings for connecting to a nonlocal G2 and/or a G2
using a nondefault port.  Note: the properties must be set before the
call to WorkstationView.ConnectToG2().

<li>This example uses ActiveX, and therefore needs to run on
Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser.

<li>The Telewindows ActiveX Control in this example is specified as being
downloadable via the Internet from a fictitious HTTP server.  If you change the
example to reflect a location where the cab file can be downloaded, there may be
a noticeable delay for the Internet Explorer browser to connect to the server
the first time the Telewindows ActiveX Control is used.  After the choice is
confirmed to download and install the control, an additional delay will occur
while the control is downloaded and installed.
