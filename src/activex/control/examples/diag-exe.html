<H2>Gensym Telewindows ActiveX Control</H2>
<i>(using separate tw.exe file)</i>
</CENTER><P>

<HR>

When any of Gensym's sample HTML pages for the Telewindows ActiveX control is
opened in Internet Explorer, it should display Telewindows in a designated area
at the top of the page.  If that is not happening properly, this page can help
you to diagnose and correct the problem.<p>

In order to diagnose the problem you are experiencing, it is helpful to
understand what is really going on with the ActiveX control.  For this version,
Telewindows always runs in a separate process.  The ActiveX control spawns a TW
process, and tells it to display itself inside of the window the control has
created.

What problem are you having?<p>

<UL>
<LI><a href="#Netscape">The browser does not create a window for TW</a>

<LI><a href="#NoTwExe">The control is not finding TW</a>
<LI><a href="#TwNoG2">TW is not connecting to G2</a>
<LI><a href="#Unsure">I'm not sure.  How can I tell?</a>

These sample HTML files are for use with Gensym's Telewindows ActiveX control.
The syntax used in the HTML will embed the control into a page using Microsoft
Internet Explorer.  The sample HTML pages do not work with Netscape Navigator,
Netscape Communicator, or any other browser.  If you are using one of these
non-Microsoft browsers, the control will essentially be ignored.  Gensym
recommends version 5.5 or newer of Internet Explorer.  If you are using an older
version, it might not behave properly either.

ActiveX  controls are identified by a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) which
is "EC99E4EE-F5F1-4323-9829-06E9B0AFB934" for Gensym's Telewindows ActiveX
control.  In order for Internet Explorer to embed the control, it must be able
to find a mapping between that UUID and an .ocx file in the system registry.
You must register the control before the OBJECT tag will work.  It is
recommended that you exit out of Internet Explorer altogether before attempting
to register the control.  Here are some ways to register the control:

<UL>
<LI>using a cabinet (.cab) file with Internet Explorer: if you open a page in IE
  which requires the ActiveX control, and the control is not registered on your
  machine, or if only an older version of the control than the page requires is
  registered on your machine, then IE will automatically install from the
  cabinet file.
  <UL>
  <LI>with an HTML file like the <i>install.html</i> file included with
  Telewindows versions 7.0 and later, which specifies a codebase of a cabinet
  file on the local file system.  Depending on the security settings of your
  browser, it will probably install it without asking you to confirm or even
  notifying you of what it is doing.

  <LI>with an HTML file like the three sample files included with Telewindows
  version 7.1r0 (<i>sample.html, classic.html, twloc.html</i>),
  which specify a codebase of a cabinet file available on a
  web server or ftp server.  Depending on the security settings of your
  browser, it will probably present you with a dialog box confirming the
  validity of the control it will install, and requiring you to authorize it to
  continue with the installation.  If your security settings are particularly
  high, IE might refuse to install the control.  You can modify your
  security settings by choosing <i>Internet Options</i> from the <i>Tools</i>
  menu of IE, and then clicking on the <i>Security</i> tab.

  </UL>
<LI>using the chktrust.exe utility from Microsoft with the cabinet file on your
  local disk.  Gensym does not provide the chktrust utility, but you can
  download it from Microsoft.  If you run <tt>chktrust TwControl.cab</tt> (from
  the directory containing TwControl.cab), it will bring up the security dialog
  box, and allow you to install the control, regardless of your security
  settings or of which version, if any, you presently have installed on the
  machine.
<LI>using an .ocx file, just use the standard Windows utility
  <i>regsvr32.exe</i> with TwControl.ocx as an argument.  Gensym ships a simple
  batch file, <i>registerTwControl.bat</i>, which will register the ocx in this
  manner for you.
</UL>



<HR>

<a name="NoTwExe"><H3>The control is not finding tw.exe</H3></a>

The Telewindows ActiveX control looks for the Telewindows executable in these
locations, in this order:
<OL>
<LI>TwLocation property of the control
<LI>TW_HOME_FOR_ACTIVEX environment variable
<LI>A file called tw.exe in the same directory as the control (TwControl.ocx) 
<LI><i>c:\Program Files\Gensym\g2-8.3\g2\tw.exe</i> is hard-coded as a final option
</OL>
<HR>

<a name="TwNoG2"><H3>Telewindows is not connecting to G2</H3></a>

You will, of course, need to have a G2 available to use Telewindows.  The
example pages are set up to connect to localhost:1111.  If that's not the
location of the G2 to which you'd like to connect, you can edit the HTML files
to point to the right place.  Here is the sample VB Script code found in the
examples:<br>
<pre>
  &lt;OBJECT CLASSID="clsid:EC99E4EE-F5F1-4323-9829-06E9B0AFB934"
          ID=WorkstationView HEIGHT=500 WIDTH=700 HSPACE=85
          codebase="http://download.example.com/gensym/TwControl.cab#Version=8,3,128,1">
  &lt;/OBJECT>
  &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=VBScript>
  ...
  <b>WorkstationView.LaunchHost = "localhost"
  WorkstationView.LaunchPort = "1111"</b>
  ...
  &lt;/SCRIPT>
</pre>

Modify the values of LaunchHost and LaunchPort to indicate the host and port of
the G2 to which you'd like to connect, and refresh the page.

<a name="Unsure"><H3>How can I tell what exactly is going wrong?</H3></a>

Let's work backwards.  The first thing to be aware of is the "Splash Screen",
which looks like this:
<br><center><img src="splash.gif"></center><br>

If you see this screen when you load the page, then Telewindows is working
properly.  The problem, therefore, must be <a href="#TwNoG2">that Telewindows
cannot make a connection to G2.</a>

<p>If the splash screen is never displayed, then Telewindows is not starting up
properly.  If you see a dialog box like the following:
<p><center><img src="no-tw-exe.gif"></center><br>

then the control is starting up properly and attempting to spawn a Telewindows
process, but it is <a href="#NoTwExe">unable to locate a Telewindows
executable.</a>

<p>If you don't see the splash screen, and there is no dialog box, then the
control is not being probably not being instantiated properly.  The behavior in
this case depends somewhat on the settings of your browser, but generally,
you'll observe the following conditions:
<UL>
<LI>the window created for Telewindows will be "blank" and colored the same as
the background of the HTML page
<LI>in the top left corner of the object window, the "object error" icon
<img src="objerror.gif"> will appear
<LI>in the status bar in the lower right corner of the Internet Explorer
window, the "page error" icon <img src="pagerror.gif"> will appear
</UL>

In this case, <a href="#OcxProb">the control is not starting properly.</a>
