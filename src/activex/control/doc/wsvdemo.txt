** Development Version

Set environment variable TW_HOME_FOR_ACTIVEX to point to the path
   of an 8.0 tw.exe, build GA28 or greater.

Set environment variable GSIDIR to a directory containing gsi header files
   (necessary only if you are going to *build* ActiveX Link)

cvs co -A activex vstudio

Register G2 ActiveX Link 1.0r8 or greater.  It is not promoted yet.
To build it, do the following:
   - copy gsi.dll into activex\G2Com\Debug
   - open activex\G2Com\G2Com.dsw
   - set active configuation to "Win32 Debug"
   - to make sure that everything works, go to the project settings, go to
     "Custom Build", and edit the command to omit the "/s".  Just do
         regsvr32 /c "$(TargetPath)"
     The /s means silent, and if you use it, and registration fails, you will
     not be informed about any problem.
   - build the project.  The final step should be a dialog box telling you that
     G2Com.dll was registered successfully

Run g2, again 8.0 GA22 or greater, on port 1112

Copy activex\G2Com\demos\g2com.kb into activex\control\examples (or use module
   search paths to make sure g2com.kb is loaded)

Load kb activex/control/examples/wsvdemo.kb.  It should start automatically.

Open vstudio/ctrl/WSViewControl.dsw; set active configuration to "Win32 Debug";
   build control

If you are using a Unix sandbox through samba, you may need to fix the VB
   project files to have only Windows newlines.

Run VB with file activex/G2Com/demos/VBDemo/WorkspaceViewDemo.vbp

When you start the project, at least one workspace should show up.  If it
doesn't, things are not working.  You may need to ask jv for help.

** Production Version

Set environment variable TW_HOME_FOR_ACTIVEX to point to the path
   of an 8.0 tw.exe, build GA28 or greater, e.g.,
   c:\Program Files\Gensym\g2-8.0a0\g2\tw.exe

Make sure G2 ActiveX Link 1.0r8 or greater is registered on your machine.
There is a file, runme.bat, which ships with AxL and registers the DLL.
   e.g., c:\Program Files\Gensym\g2-8.0a0\activexlink\runme.bat

Run "registerWSV.bat"
   e.g., c:\Program Files\Gensym\g2-8.0a0\g2\registerWSV.bat


Run g2, again 8.0 GA28 or greater, on port 1112
  (that's 1112, not 1111!!!  The VB Demo has the port hard-coded)

Load kb wsvdemo.kb from the G2 directory.  It should start automatically.
  It will pull in two other kbs: g2com.kb and workspace-views.kb
  e.g., c:\Program Files\Gensym\g2-8.0a0\g2\wsvdemo.kb

Run VB with project WorkspaceViewDemo.vbp
  e.g., c:\Program Files\Gensym\g2-8.0a0\g2\WorkspaceViewDemo.vbp

It should display two workspaces.  You can supply different names or UUIDs to
view other workspaces.  G2 must be running and must have workspace-views.kb
and g2com.kb loaded.  You certainly should be able to merge in other kbs and
look at their workspaces as well.

Note you can transfer and clone items from one workspace view into the other
one.

There is also an html demo, wsview.html.
