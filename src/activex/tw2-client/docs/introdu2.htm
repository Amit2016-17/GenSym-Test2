<h1> What is ActiveX?</h1>
</a><a name="13845">
ActiveX controls are part of the development of reusable software components. An ActiveX control is a software component, conforming to Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM), that can interact with your application to perform operations, such as a timer control in Microsoft Visual Basic. Any application or language that provides an ActiveX control container can use an ActiveX control. <p>
</a><a name="14280">
ActiveX controls define a set of properties, methods, and events that can be used by a container application such as Visual Basic. Properties provide a set of values or characteristics that can be set and read, or only read. A container application can use the features of an ActiveX control by invoking its methods. An ActiveX control can raise events to a container application, and the connected container application can respond to these events. <p>
</a><a name="13850">
ActiveX is the "glue" between software components and the objects that make up software components. ActiveX uses Automation, enabling one application to use another. By using Automation, a Microsoft Word document, for example, can have an Excel &#32;97 spreadsheet embedded in it. All editing of the spreadsheet takes places inside the Word document without the need for opening a separate Excel &#32;97 window.<p>
