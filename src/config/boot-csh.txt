# Standard .cshrc for Gensym's Unix systems
#
# To get the standard Gensym Unix environment -- "Mr. AB's environment" -- have
# csh do what this file does.  If you are sure you just want Mr. AB and nothing
# else, you could simply symlink to this file:
#    ln -s /home/development/boot-csh.txt ~/.cshrc
# More likely, if you want to start with Mr. AB and then add a few things of
# your own, you can copy this file to your .cshrc, and then add lines at the
# bottom.
#
# To test changes you want to make to Mr. AB's environment, you should check out
# the "config" directory (say, as ~/config), and set SCRIPTSBOX to the directory
# where you have checked it out.  Then you can modify your local files, and run
# a new shell to see how it goes.  When you are sure it works, you check in your
# changes, update /home/development, and then can change your SCRIPTSBOX back to
# /home/development.  -jv, 12/5/07
#
# This sources the following files from SOURCE_HOME, which should be a
# directory containing the "scripts" CVS module in the latest spin:
# 
#    base-cshrc.txt path.txt aliases.txt stty.txt
#
#
# MHD 4/8/92, JV 11/26/07
#

# The following sets up the SCRIPTSBOX environment variable.  This was formerly
# AB_HOME, which was, /disc/ab, then became /home/ab (as of 9/16/92), but is now
# /home/development.

setenv SCRIPTSBOX /home/development


# To keep this stuff under source code control, do very little here.
# Instead, source another file that is checked in:

source ${SCRIPTSBOX}/config/base-cshrc.txt
