// If, for example, you hit the "Escape" key while the dropdown box is showing,
// there is no problem.  Whatever that does, is what should happen.  Hitting the
// "ok" button while the box is dropped down should be like doing a 
   structure(control-type: the symbol text-box,
             control-id: the symbol doc-box,
             control-value: structure(text-value ""),
             height: 48, width: 290, left: 10, top: 10,
             is-multiline: true, is-readonly: true),
