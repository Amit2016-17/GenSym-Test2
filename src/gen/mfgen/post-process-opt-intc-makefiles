# Usage: post-process-opt-intc-makefiles makefile

# The purpose of this script is to edit in place the Intel compiler makefiles.
# We need to add the lines

# cc = icl
# link = xilink

# AFTER the line 
# !include <ntwin32.mak>

# in the comments-prologue section (see gen/mfgen/templates.rel).  However there
# does not appear to be any pre-existing mechanism in the makefile generator to
# make changes at this location.  Previously, we were manually editing the files,
# after creating these variable declarations in the "variables" section.  But
# that section goes before comments-prologue, and the variable declarations
# don't work unless they are done after the include.  The script is "temporary"
# until we figure out how to change the makefile generator.

# --yduJ, 6/7/04.  (Perl code below from fmw, 6/6/04.)
