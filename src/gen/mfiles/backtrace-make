# Makefile for the backtrac.o file
#
# backtrac.o file is stored in platform specific subdirectories of the specific module
# backtrac.c file is stored in ext/c with all other custom C files
#
# The reason for this is that backtrac.o must always be compiled with gcc in order to
# be useful, while gcc is not our default compiler on some platforms. 
#
# Currently there are only targets for those platforms for which gcc is currently installed.
#
# example uses:
#	/bt/ajs> make -f gen/mfiles/backtrace-make  alphaosf/backtrac.o
#	D:\bt\ajs> nmake -f gen\mfiles\backtrace-make intelnt\backtrac.obj
#
# Note: this makefile requires the SRCBOX environment variable to be bound.
