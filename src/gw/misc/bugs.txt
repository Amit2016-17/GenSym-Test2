Tendering URLs
--------------

If you tender a URL with a procedure P in G2 and P is unavailable when
the user requests the URL the bridge will report and error and then shutdown.
The most common senario where this arises is when P is inactive and has
notes because it was just revised.

Netscape problem with Single Line Resources
-------------------------------------------

Some Browsers, Netscape Navigator 2.0 for example, will report that
they recieved no data if they fetch a text resource containing no
line terminators at all.  It is easy to work around the problem
making sure your resources have more than one line in them.


Post Method
-----------

The HTTP protocol is usually used to "get" resources.  It may also be used
to "post" resources.  Posting is not currently supported.

G2 problems with Images
-----------------------

G2 doesn't like interlaced GIF files.  G2 doesn't like JPEG files.

G2 problem with Drawing Parameters
----------------------------------

Do not set the drawing pallet in drawing parameters to custom colors
from a particular image-definition when that image-definition has
notes.  If you do the drawing parameters will become inactive and
you will have to restart to clear that state.

Cache Refresh
-------------

The bridge currently does not check that cache entries are uptodate.
For example if you fetch the a resource once the cache entry will
be returned from then on.  You can workaround this problem by
setting the fetch style to ignore the cache.


Cache Overflow
--------------

The cache is not currently flushed to clear old entries.
