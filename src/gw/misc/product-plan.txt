- World Wide Web?
 - Nielsen Survey: 18 million north americans used WWW in last 3 months.
 - Nielsen Survey: 24 million used internet mostly at work.
 - Explosive growth.
  - 10 Million Web pages + .3 Million/week
  - Advertising: 
     - www.sportzone.com $100K/3Months
     - www.lycos.com $18K/Million Impressions
 - An emerging market
   - Time to Market counts
 - THE solution to client/server?
 - The client interface on Legacy software
  - Isn't this one of Gensym's core markets?
 - Not Microsoft?




- Market?  
 - Inside corporations.
 - Like a bridge? ... not really.
   - Most bridges require three things.
     - A legacy application we bridge.
     - G2 application
     - A desire to bridge between them.
   - But not this one.
     - If we target all existing G2 customers.
     - All customers already or soon will have
       the "legacy application" i.e. the web and a web browser.
     - Desire... see below
 - Most every existing G2 customer is a possible buyer.
 - All customers with legacy systems we currently have bridges too
   are possible customers.
   - Not currently G2 customers.
   - Buy this & the bridge to their legacy system and 
     quickly they can create web client interfaces.




- Customer Value
 - Leverages his existing Software & Hardware
  - his suite of desktop machines.
  - his suite of legacy systems (for which we have bridges).
  - his G2 (for those customers we already sold to).
 - Need
  - Dead Simple interfaces
    - very safe (i.e. avoids risk, and embaressment)
  - his need to wider exposure on his existing system.
    - internal demand for access
    - his need for self promotion.
  - site manager's need to justify desk top machines.
 - Problems solved
  - wide access
  - safe interface
 - Costs
  - free! low configuration barriers
  - work: user has to build Web pages, and G2 app.
  - $: buy bridge & possibly G2.



- Are web browsers THE client software?
 - Yes
  - NO barrier to entry
    - The Zero cost User Interface
    - Costs already paid by client (i.e. he's got the web browser).
    - Desk top machine already on Internet.
    - Desk top machine already has browser.
    - User is already trained in interaction paradigm.
    - User is already addicted to the interface
 - NO
  - Too Primitive a paradigm?
  - Too slow 
  - Primitive graphics?
  - Primitive Interactions
  - Good News? -- Trade up to Telewindows
  - Bad News? -- Java et. al. are comming.




- Why is this good for Gensym?
 - Leverage existing assets
  - existing customers
  - existing bridges (new G2 advantages)
  - Telewindows trade up path  
 - Preempts a marketing problem
  - Our customers are going to demand a good Internet story.
 - Meets a competitor ASAP
  - learning curve
  - time to market
  - Web apps compete directly with G2.
    - Both provide facade on legacy software.
    - Both provide desktop/back room bridging.
    - Both provide more accessible user interface.
    - Both (will) have strong server side computation.
    - Both provide a platform independent solution.
 - manages the risk this is a paradigm shift.
   - "Netscape is nolonger a browser, it is more like an 
      operating system."
   - Open standards are creating a very dynamic market.
     - InternetWorld 2* last year: 250 exhibitors, 30K guests.
   - Java is creating a sharp awareness client potentials





- How quickly can we move?
 - Very.
 - We can ship this quarter.

 "Fundamentally, we'd like to make a better
  product," said Mike Conte, group manager of the
  personal systems division at Microsoft. When
  asked about Netscape's dominance in the market,
  Conte noted that the geometric change and
  remarkably compressed product cycles in the
  Internet space mean that "by definition,
  everything that has happened doesn't quite
  matter."
