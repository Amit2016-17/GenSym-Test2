<H2>Fidelity</H2>

<p>
Fidelity uses G2 to aggregate data about the health and progress of the
machines and applications used in their operations.  Simple Network
Management Protocol is used to move this data from the various
applications and hardware to the G2 where it is filtered for problems.

<p>
Fidelity's original application idea for the bridge import portions of
their contigency planning documentation into G2 where it could be
presented to the operators immediately after G2 identified a the problem.

<p>
A second idea was to apply the bridge to enable additional client
interfaces to their application.  This was attractive for three
reasons:

<UL>
  <LI> Many desk tops at Fidelity already have a web browser installed.
  <LI> A Web interface into G2 seen as safer, since it is so simplistic.
  <LI> A graceful trade up path to G2 allows them to offer a customers better
client solution when they need it.<BR>
  <LI> The short duration of the browser's connection with the Bridge was seen
as eaiser to manage.

<H2>Pfizer</H2>

<p>
Harry Lam is a big G2 fan at Pfizer.  They use G2 to do batch planning and
have big plans for other applications.  He is convinced that the default
client software for most desktops will soon be the Web browser.  He's very
excited by the possiblities offerd by Java to extend the browser's interface
in complex ways.

<p>
He would love to be a Beta customer.  He would be happy to bend anybodies
ear about how important it is to have a Web Browser interface into G2.
