<h1> Using Standard Generalized Markup Language </h1>
</a><a name="2505">
Standard Generalized Markup Language, or SGML, is the common name used for 
ISO 8879 - 1986 (also FIPS 152) an international standard for electronic document 
exchange. SGML is the standard upon which HTML was built.
<p>
</a><a name="2506">
An SGML document is a stream of characters that can be organized into a 
hierarchy of elements. For example most HTML documents are broken into two 
sub-elements a header and a body. The body might contain paragraphs. Individual paragraphs might containing elements in italic.
<p>
</a><a name="2507">
An SGML document can be parsed into this hierarchy of elements with the 
guidance of a declaration specific to a family of documents known as a document 
type definition, or DTD. With the help of a DTD an SGML parser can create a 
hierarchy of elements from the stream of characters that make up the document. 
<p>
</a><a name="2508">
Elements in a document can have attributes in addition to sub-elements. In 
HTML, for example, a hypertext link is created by creating elements known as an 
anchor with the URL to link to as an attribute.
<p>

While HTML is the most common SGML DTD used in the World Wide Web, 
dozens if not hundreds of other DTD exist for purposes as widely varied as DOD 
specifications to musical notation.
