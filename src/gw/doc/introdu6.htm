<h1> Transcripts of G2 WebLink Operation </h1>
</a><a name="2743">
While G2 WebLink is running, it displays information about its operation on the 
background screen of the console where it was invoked. This transcript or log is 
formatted to include an indication of the date. 
<p>
</a><a name="2744">
If G2 WebLink suffers a crash or internal error, the background transcript will 
include a backtrace that attempts to record exactly what G2 WebLink was doing at 
the time of the failure. When reporting the failure please include this information 
along with as much of the transcript as possible.
