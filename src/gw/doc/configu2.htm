<h1> Optional Steps for Configuring G2 WebLink </h1>
</a><a name="2638">
You can optionally modify how G2 maintains the connection to G2 WebLink by 
customizing the G2 procedure <code>monitor-gsi-interface-to-gw()</code>, which ensures the 
reliable operation of the connection between G2 and G2 WebLink. 
<p>
</a><a name="2644">
The version of monitor-gsi-interface-to-gw() provided with G2 WebLink should 
be suitable for almost all purposes. Do not modify this procedure unless you have 
a specific need to do so, and are certain that you understand how the procedure 
works.

<h2> Ensuring a Reliable Connection </h2>
</a><a name="2668">
The maintenance of a reliable connection to G2 WebLink is supported by the 
procedure <code>monitor-gsi-interface-to-gw()</code>. One instance of this procedure should be 
launched for the gsi connection. It calls <code>gw-ping()</code> at regular intervals, and if it 
finds that the connection is broken, it attempts to reestablish the connection after 
closing the old one. 
<p>
</a><a name="2670">
The OS shell script that runs G2 WebLink should usually be configured to restart 
G2 WebLink automatically if it shuts down. This improves reliability if G2 
WebLink were to crash. It is also useful if the G2 shuts G2 WebLink down explicitly.

<hr><strong>Note:</strong> The version of <code>monitor-gsi-interface-to-gw()</code> provided with G2 WebLink 
should be suitable for almost all purposes. Do not modify this procedure 
unless you have a specific need to do so, and are certain that you understand how the procedure works.
