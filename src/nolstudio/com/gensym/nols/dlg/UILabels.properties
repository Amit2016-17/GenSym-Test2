# NolNewOptimizationWizard.java
NolNewGenOptimizationWizard_GeneralLabel = An optimization problem is about finding values of some variables to minimize/maximize a certain objective. You can create an optimization object following the instruction of this wizard.
NolNewGenOptimizationWizard_NameEditLabel = Enter the name for this optimization:
NolNewGenOptimizationWizard_ModelLabel = What model has been used for this optimization? 
NolNewGenOptimizationWizard_ModelSelectionLabel = Select NOLStudio models you want to use in your optimization problem? 
NolNewGenOptimizationWizard_Model = Model
NolNewGenOptimizationWizard_VariableLabel = You can define the independent variables here. The variables can either have a name or in the form of array.
NolNewGenOptimizationWizard_ObjectiveLabel = Objective function gives the target value to be minimized/maximized. You can define your objective function here or later through the objective function property workspace.
NolNewGenOptimizationWizard_BoundLabel = You can define the bounds on each variable here. Default values for a lower bound is -INFBOUND or "minus infinity." and a upper bound is +INFBOUND or "plus infinity."
