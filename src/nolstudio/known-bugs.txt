KNOWN BUGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. You might notice while using NOL Studio "nonfatal errors" produced by the Java VM and appearing
on the console in the background while running under JIT compilation (the default). 
Ignore these for they have already been submitted to Sun, and thus do not need to be 
reported as stated.

2. The changes of properties of variables and data series such as name and color, etc. 
are not propagated. You need to re-open the property table to view the changes.

3. If the formulas are changed after a model is built from the same preprocessor, 
the model may be invalid. In such a case you can not validate the model and should not 
export the whole model, but the weights of the model. 

4. You cannot load version 1.0rx projects containing optimization models into version 4.x 
environment.

5. The line chart will not be able to display in time mode, if there are same time stamps 
in a data series.

6. When appending a data series, the spreadsheet should be closed if opened for this particular 
data series. 

7. Printing sometimes will use a large amount of memory and is slow.
