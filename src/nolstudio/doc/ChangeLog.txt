                     ==============


Creating of this file. Goal is to capture implementation issues and changes that should be
described at a higher level then at the code level. Many times we make changes in different
areas of the code to solve a unique goal. Such changes as well as the overall goal or alg.
should be described in this log file. While describing changes specifics of files and methods
that are changed are always very helpffull!

The format is simple: text based to ensure cvs can do its job, each entry is separated by
a line as above and starts with the name of the person that edited it and followed by the
date of the changes.
