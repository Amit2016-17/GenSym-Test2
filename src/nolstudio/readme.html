<h2>What is NeurOn-Line Studio?</h2>
NeurOn-Line Studio (NOL Studio) is a graphical, object-oriented software
product for building neural network applications. Using NOL Studio, you
can model dynamic, nonlinear phenomena that are difficult to describe by
analytical models, using historical data stored in databases, process data
historians, or text files. Typical applications include quality assurance,
sensor validation, diagnosis, and process modeling.

<h2>
How can I begin using NeurOn-Line Studio?</h2>
<ul>

After installing NOL Studio you can run NOLStudio by going to Start Menu Program Files->
Gensym G2 NOL 5.0r0->G2 NeurOn-Line Studio, which uses the nolstudio.bat to launch the 
NOLStudio main frame window.

<ul>
<li>
Run the NOL Studio with example data series</li>

<ul>This release ships with 7 examples. Each of these can be found in <a href="project/examples/DataSet">examples
directory</a> (%NOLSTUDIO_HOME%\examples\DataSet). They include example
data series that can be loaded into NOL Studio.</ul>

<li>
Use demo projects in Visual Basic to test the implementation of ActiveX
Controls.</li>

<ul>Three demos can be found in <a href="project/examples/ActiveXDemo">examples
directory</a> (%NOLSTUDIO_HOME%\examples\ActiveXDemo). They include two
demos for NOLPredictor and one for NOLOptimizer.</ul>

<li>
Use demo kbs to test the implementation of models and optimizations in
G2.</li>

<ul>Complete demos can be found in <a href="../nol/examples/gnne-demo">examples 
directory</a>. They include one demo using Gensym Neural Network Engine and NOL Studio.</ul>

<li>
Use your own data to preprocess data, generate models and deploy them using
either G2 or through ActiveX.</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.gensym-support.com">Query for the current list of bugs</a>
to make sure that you are not encountering known problems.</li>
