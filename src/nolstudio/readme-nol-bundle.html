<h2>NeurOn-Line Package Overview</h2>

Gensym's NeurOn-Line (NOL) platform enables process-manufacturing
companies in a variety of industries to realize substantial economic 
benefits from improved efficiency and product quality. Applications
of the NOL platform include inferential measurements of product quality, 
model-based control, and process fault detection.
<p>
The platform includes four packages: 
<p>
<li>NOL Studio Development and Deployment packages for the development 
and deployment of neural network models and embedded deployment in 
Windows environments.</li>

<li>NOL Premium Development and Deployment packages for Windows and 
G2-based development and deployment.</li> 

<li>NOL Evaluation packages for Windows development.</li> 


<A name=200></A>
<h2>NOL Studio Packages</h2>

NOL Studio packages can be used offline for model analysis or online 
for real-time, model-based diagnostics and control. For offline use, 
NOL Studio packages are desktop tools in the Windows (2000/XP) 
environment for analysis of process behavior, modeling, and design 
optimization. Typically, the source of data is a data historian or 
spreadsheet data arrays. Many technical decisions such as selection of 
relevant inputs, time delays, and network architecture are automated. 
Once a model has been built, NOL Studio enables users to discover more 
profitable ways to run their process through simulation and optimization.
<p>
For online use, NOL Studio has two options. NOL Studio models can be:
Deployed as Microsoft ActiveX components in Windows applications.
Loaded into the standard G2-based NOL packages for execution in a
G2-based environment, which brings the added capabilities of G2          
for expert operations.
<p>
The NOL Studio Development and (Active X model) Deployment packages         
are restricted to a single model and single site per license. See           
your Gensym sales representative for pricing. 
<p>
Note that the NOL Studio Deployment package for ActiveX does not                    
offer user access to G2.

<h2>NOL Premium Packages </h2>

The NOL Premium packages include NOL Studio packages and additional 
packages that work in the G2 environment to deliver intelligent, 
real-time, process monitoring and analysis applications with a 
comprehensive suite of easy-to-use neural-network technology, 
provided through graphical object libraries. Powerful prediction 
diagrams of graphically connected NOL objects execute and document 
the application functionality, enabling fast deployment and easy 
maintenance.
<p>
The NOL Premium Development package includes a G2 development license,   
Gensym Neural Network Engine, NOL Classic, and NOL Studio for online use.
The package also offers G2 ProTools, GDA, Telewindows, G2-WebLink, G2-JavaLink, 
G2-ActiveXLink, G2 Gateway (GSI), and any two of the eight available 
bridges listed in the next section. The package is restricted to 
one user per license.             						
<p>
The NOL Premium Deployment package provides you tools to build models   
from NOL Studio, Gensym Neural Network Engine, and NOL Classic, in a graphical environment.  
The package gives you access to deployment-only G2s to extend the    
functionality of the application. The package allows up to four users per 
license and includes G2, GDA, NOL Studio Deployment, and any two of the 
eight available bridges

<A name=400></A>
<h2>Available Bridges </h2>

For NOL Premium Packages only (NOL Studio packages are not applicable).
<ul>
<li>OPCLink	Bridge</li>
<li>CorbaLink Bridge</li>
<li>ODBC Bridge	</li>
<li>Oracle Bridge </li>
<li>Sybase Bridge </li> 
<li>Pi Bridge	</li>
<li>JMS	Bridge</li>
<li>JMail Bridge</li>
<p>
</ul>
Using two deployments of the same bridge count as two bridges. Bridges 
not included in the package will be billed in addition to the package.

<h2>How Can I Begin Using NeurOn-Line Packages?</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>Windows Platform</h3> </li>

<ul>
<li><strong>NOL Studio</strong></li> <p>

After installing NOL Studio you can run NOLStudio by going to Start Menu Program Files->
Gensym NOL 5.0r0->NeurOnLine->NeurOn-Line Studio, which uses the nolstudio.bat to launch the 
NOLStudio main frame window.

<ul>
<li>
Run the NOL Studio with example data series</li>

<ul>This release ships with 7 examples. Each of these can be found in <a href="nolstudio/project/examples/DataSet">examples
directory</a>. They include example
data series that can be loaded into NOL Studio.</ul>

<li>
Use demo projects in Visual Basic to test the implementation of ActiveX
Controls.</li>

<ul>Three demos can be found in <a href="nolstudio/project/examples/ActiveXDemo">examples
directory</a>. They include two
demos for NOLPredictor and one for NOLOptimizer.</ul>

<li>
Use your own data to preprocess data, generate models and deploy them using
either G2 or through ActiveX.</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.gensym-support.com">Query for the current list of bugs</a>
to make sure that you are not encountering known problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<li><strong>Demos for G2 deployment of NOL Gensym Neural Network Engine and NOLStudio models</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Use demo kbs gnne-demo.kb to test the implementation of models developed from Gensym Neural Network Engine
and NOLStudio. You can launch this demo through Start Menu Program Files->Gensym NOL 5.0r0->Examples\Gensym NeurOnLine->Neural Network Engine Demo</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<HR>
NOTES:   
<ul>
The nolexten.kb module in previous version before 4.1r1 has been deleted. All the items are merged 
into nol.kb. If you have an existing nol application using ensemble model build from 
nolstudio, please follow these steps to upgrade to a version later than 4.1r1:
<ul>
<li>Make a backup copy of the application.</li>
<li>Load your application with an empty nolexten module. An empty nolexten.kb is provided in the nol
directory. </li>
<li>Once you load your application delete the nolexten module from your module hierarchy.</li>
<li>Save the upgraded application.
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Online Documentation</h2>


Online documentation is a part of each NOL Bundle package. The default 
installation directory for NOL Studio package is:
C:\Program Files\Gensym\NOL-5.0r0\doc\NOLStudio and the default 
installation directory for Gensym Neural Network and NOL Classic packages is: C:\Program Files\Gensym\NOL-5.0r0\doc\NOL
<p>
The default installation directory for most G2 Classic documentation 
files is C:\Program Files\Gensym\NOL-5.0r0\doc\g2. The default installation 
directory for most NOL documentation files is inside the corresponding 
software directory.

<h2> Known Problems</h2>
<ul>

<li><h3> Upgrade Problems</h3> </li>
<ul>

<li>Upgrade ActiveX Control</li>
<ul>
The ActiveX controls of NOL Studio contained in 4.1 are not backward-compatible with the
controls in previous NOL Studio releases. If you have existing files from a COM compliant
environment (such as a VB project file) that incorporate NOL Studio controls, please follow 
the instructions explained in NOL Studio Users' Guide to upgrade your application.
</ul>
<li>Upgrade NOL kbs</li>
<ul>
If you are loading an existing KB that was developed in NOL 40r1 with a 2.2r0 bundle license 
into current 4.1r2 bundle, you may have NOL blocks with wrong UUIDs. You need to run 
gdl-force-total-recompile() after you load the KB. You can create an action button anywhere to 
start this procedure. This will flush & regenerate the UUIDs. You can delete the button you just
create after this process is complete.
