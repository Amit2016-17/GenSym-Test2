supervisor should remove log files before a "clean" build
key bindings -- control-z should be disabled for developer mode 

Kill dead platforms on 6build: mips, vax, sun4, alphant, and sgi

unmuddy toolsdir situation
logs should be TOOLSDIR/logs, not SRCBOX/logs
        (But not really -- toolsdir situation is muddy.)

We also really want to switch the translation machine over to burlington, but
can't because of the "Lisp can't load 2.8 static archives" problems.  There are
a number of ways around this.  Supervisor could build the archives on bluto
ahead of time.  Or, run-translator could be smart enough to do a uname and rsh
the library builds first.  Or we could try to figure out the problem and then
build everything on burlington.  [Is this still a problem?]

Send mail to people after builds are complete.

Might like to redo the kbs build thing so that the pieces that know about
specific files aren't so far apart (e.g. cvs-changes.txt, the log file).
Perhaps redo using a separate workspace entirely, maybe with module search path
passed in as env var with the new #### for spaces thing.

Change name of intelnt machine in supagent to match NEW machine.
Remove diff tasks from ab, et.
