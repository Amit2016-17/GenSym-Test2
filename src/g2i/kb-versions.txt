# KB Version Configuration file.
#
# At startup in development mode (i.e. with gdev module loaded), two sections of
# this file are loaded into G2 to define the current version used to set the
# module version. The sections are named G2-8 and G2-7, each corresponding to
# the G2 versions. You may keep other sections in the file for older version that
# were build for previous G2 versions, but will not be the active ones. Initially
# I wanted to read the section corresponding to the running G2 version, but that
# would exclude creating the kbs for a bundle version that does not correspond to
# the current running G2 (for example build the kbs for a G2 8.0r1 bundle using
# G2 8.0r0.
#
#
# Notes about version numbers:
#	- xxx-PACKAGE-NAME : kept in there as the title of the package (i.e. the
#		title on the top level workspace), but typically is never changed.
#	- xxx-CURRENT-VERSION : the text representation of the current version
#	- xxx-CURRENT-VERSION-NUMBER : the number of the current version number.
#		We use the practive of encoding the version number as an integer.
#		For example 4.3r1 corresponds to 4030120 as the version number.
#		The last two digits encode Alpha version (0 to 9, i.e. up to 10
#		Alpha releases), Beta versions (10 to 19, i.e. up to 10 Beta
#		releases) and build/patch id. For the build/patch id, use the
#		following encoding: 20 is the official release, 21 to 99 are patches
#		of the version/revisions (incremental numbers), 0 to 
#		Formula using two forms
#		  1. major * 1000000 + minor * 10000 (2 digits)
#		    + revision (2 digits) * 100
#		    + build/patch index per version/revision (2 digits)
#		  2. Mmmrrbb, where MM = major version number, mm = minor version
#		     number, rr = revision version number, bb = build id
#		     starting at 0 for each version/revision (the last two digits
#		     of any official release will always be 20 and is incremented
#		     as we deliver patches of modules).
#               Note:  If you are creating a second alpha or beta, you do not 
#               increment the "revision" rr numbers, but only the alpha or beta
#               build numbers (last two digits)
#	- xxx-OLDEST-VERSION : the oldest version the kb is compatible with. See
#		GFR for greater details. Typically not changed/used and left to 0.
#	- xxx-PROPRIETARY-PACKAGE : the keywork/syntax to make a kb proprietary.
#		This is left in the file since the keywords may change between
#		major versions.
#
#	Do not forget to update the target G2 version that the kbs should be 
#	associated with in entries: G2-VERSION-NUMBER, G2-CURRENT-VERSION-NUMBER,
#	G2-OLDEST-VERSION-NUMBER, G2-MINIMUM-VERSION.
#
#	Never decrease version numbers otherwise GFR will complain at startup!
