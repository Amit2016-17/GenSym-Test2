e-SCOR provides a graphical modeling environment for the dynamic analysis of supply chains, based on the Supply Chain Council's SCOR reference model. You can use e-SCOR to:
</p>
<ul><p><a name="34407"></a>
<li>Represent your supply chain in terms of the four SCOR processes-Plan, Source, Make, and Deliver-and to compute numerous SCOR metrics, based on your supply-chain model, such as inventory levels, standard asset calculations, order fulfillment response times, and operating costs. 
</p><p><a name="34410"></a>
<li>Make timely, informed business decisions about the structure of your supply chain, such as the number and location of distribution sites. 
</p><p><a name="34412"></a>
<li>Determine the correct service levels to offer to customers and the costs of providing that service when, for example, outsourcing finished goods. 
</p><p><a name="34414"></a>
<li>Benchmark your current supply chain and compare the results of alternative supply-chain scenarios, for example, by contrasting normal and increased demand, or by juxtaposing alternative order-fulfillment strategies, using the same demand. 
</p><p><a name="34417"></a>
<li>Analyze the impact on your supply chain of implementing e-business strategies.

<h1> Software Requirements</h1>
</a><p><a name="34482"></a>
e-SCOR integrates with Excel to report results and chart trends; therefore, you need to install Excel 2000 SR-1 or Microsoft Excel 97 SR-2, depending on whether you are running Windows XP/2000 Professional or Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 6, respectively.
</p>
<p><a name="34485"></a>
e-SCOR requires that you install Acrobat Reader 4.0 or later, which you need to read online documentation. Acrobat Reader is freely available on the Internet. Gensym does not provide any support or warranty for this product. Please contact Adobe for any issues about Acrobat Reader. 
</p>
<p><a name="34489"></a>
As part of the installation process, e-SCOR automatically installs the Java Runtime Environment Version 1.3 (JRE 1.3), which is required to run the e-SCOR client. e-SCOR uses its own installed version of JRE, so it does not conflict with any existing versions you might have installed. 
</p>
<a name="47904">
<h1> Windows XP and 2000 Users</h1>
</a><p><a name="47905"></a>
To install e-SCOR on Windows XP or 2000, you must have administrator privileges.
</p>
<p><a name="47906"></a>
After installation, a user without administrator privileges cannot run e-SCOR until the file permissions on the installed files have been changed. The recommended way to do this is to have the administrator follows these steps after installation: 
</p>
<ol><a name="47907"></a>
<li value="1	">Choose Properties on the folder that contains the e-SCOR software, <code>escor_rethink</code>, by default.<p>
<a name="47908"></a>
<li value="2	">Click the Security tab, then click the Advanced button.<p>
<a name="47909"></a>
<li value="3	">Enable the "Reset permissions on all child objects and enable propagation of inheritable permissions" option.<p>
</ol><p><a name="47910"></a>
Enabling this option allows the user to run e-SCOR without giving administrator privileges. The user can now run e-SCOR.
</p>
<a name="34493">
<h1> New Features</h1>
</a><p><a name="1001796"></a>
The only new feature for e-SCOR Version 4.0 Rev. 3 is that it includes Version 6.2 Rev. 2 of the G2 Bundle. e-SCOR Version 4.0 Rev. 2 included Version 6.2 Rev. 1 of the bundle.
</p>
<a name="34631">
<h1> Bug Fixes</h1>
</a><p><a name="34633"></a>
e-SCOR Version 4.0 Rev. 3 fixes one bug from Version 4.0 Rev. 2. 
</p>
<p><a name="1002107"></a>
Previously, the Order Fulfillment Lead Time metric of a product composite was a negative number when the Build Time Dependent on Order Size parameter of the product composite was enabled and the associated category used temporal constraints. The model now computes the correct value for Order Fulfillment Lead Time.
</p>

<h1> Known Problems</h1>
</a><p><a name="34647"></a>
e-SCOR Version 4.0 Rev. 3 has the following known problems:
</p>
<ul><p><a name="34649"></a>
<li>If you are using NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 or earlier you will need to upgrade to NT 4.0 Service Pack 6, which is available from Microsoft 
</p><p><a name="34651"></a>
<li>If you pause the server from the client, the user interface may hang since it cannot execute the required procedures on the server. The feature to control the server is only intended to start the server if you open an older model, based on G2 Version 5.x. If you open such a model into the new version, which is based on G2 6.0, the server will update the KB, however, you will need to start the server manually. 
</p><p><a name="34655"></a>
<li>We know of at least one product, namely Visio, which conflicts with creating reports in Excel, using e-SCOR. These products create hidden files with an Excel file extension (.xls) in the XLStart directory in Excel. The macros of these hidden files conflict with e-SCOR Excel macros. In the case of the Visio macros, e-SCOR opens the spreadsheets, but then opens a second spreadsheet in which it displays the results. To fix this problem, remove all files from the XLStart directory and ensure that only the e-SCOR workbook is loaded into Excel. 
</p><p><a name="34660"></a>
<li>If you are using Microsoft Office 2000, you have to change the security level within Excel from High to Medium or Low. Otherwise, Excel will never prompt you to Enable Macros. To do this, choose Tools Macro Security. The default e-SCOR report defines a macro that format the report in Excel; thus, you must enable macros when you first open the default report or any report that is based on this default. 
</p><p><a name="34664"></a>
<li>On certain installations, when you exit Excel with an e-SCOR spreadsheet loaded, Excel might not shut down properly, due to the Visual Basic code and ActiveX control that is loaded. The error happens when you are running Windows NT 4.0 with Office 97-SR-2; however, Excel shuts down properly if you are running Windows NT 2000 with Excel 2000 SR-1 or Windows NT 4.0 with Excel 2000 SR-1. 
</p><p><a name="34668"></a>
<li>The Model Browser tree does not refresh correctly when connecting to a server after the client has been launched. When connecting to a server at startup, the Model Browser works fine. The Model Browser does not automatically refresh when renaming objects, adding objects to the model, or deleting objects from the model. To refresh the Model Browser display, collapse and expand the tree. 
</p><p><a name="34672"></a>
<li>Defining the Order Release to Build Time parameter on the Make category causes the simulation performance to slow down and generate unexpected simulation results. Therefore, this parameter is grayed out on all dialogs. 
</p><p><a name="34674"></a>
<li>If you upgrade your older models and unselected the upgrade flag on some roles, you must either manually reconfigure the category process detail of these roles to reflect the current flow or delete the existing role and replace it with a new one from the palette. The process flow related to P2 and P3 has changed. In case you perform the change manually, you must delete any blue path connected to P2 and P3 and delete any extra connector on the detail of P2 and P3. You should also check that the category router on the blue input path in front of the Deliver blocks (D1-D3) is a category branch block and not a category copy block (triangular icon). 
</p><p><a name="34680"></a>
<li>A Distributor role that is configured to do kitting may order too many products during its planning phase. 
</p><p><a name="996968"></a>
<li>When a D1 or D2 category delivers orders to buyers that allow partial orders and that specify an order selection Sort Direction other than Random, under some circumstances orders might not be delivered exactly in sequence. Sometimes, the Deliver category starts delivering the next partial order before it finishes the remaining partial delivery of the previous order. This situation can occur if an order cannot be fulfilled completely due to lack of available inventory, which forces a partial delivery, then, within the same second, inventory is received, which forces a reevaluation of the orders to be delivered within that second. If the previous order has not yet been reinserted into the orders pool, the Deliver category delivers the next order before delivering the remaining partial order. The remaining partial order propagates from D1.9 to D1.3 and then to D1.7.
</p><p><a name="998899"></a>
<li>After a planning cycle is triggered in the P2 block, the replenishment order is delayed for 2 seconds. This delay is necessary to synchronize the model so that different types of events are not all scheduled in the same second. However, this may be an issue for models that rely on exact timing, especially when no cycle times are defined.
</p><p><a name="999560"></a>
<li>Certain performance metrics only update when an activity occurs within the category, such as a product shipment is sent or received. These metrics include the Delivery Performance of the ED category and the Supplier On-Time Performance of the ES category. As a result, although no activity is occurring, the performance metrics continue to show "good" values, rather than showing declining performance over time because, for example, no shipments are being sent or received.
</p><p><a name="999561"></a>
<li>When using contracts, an error can sometimes occur just after a contract expires and just before the next contract is in effect. This situation can occur when a supplier receives an order from a buyer at the exact same time that the supplier's contract expires and is in the process of been renewed. This can happen when the Order Receipt to Entry Time parameter of the D1 category has a value greater than zero. When this situation occurs, the order might refer to a purchase award with a contract that has already expired and been removed from the Supplier Awards Pool, which causes the error.
</p><p><a name="999562"></a>
<li>When a D1 or D2 category delivers orders to a buyer that allows partial orders and has its order selection Sort Direction configured to a value other than Random, orders can be delivered out of sequence. In particular, sometimes the Deliver category delivers the partial shipment of the next order before finishing the remaining partial shipment of the current order. This can happen when an order cannot be fulfilled completely due to lack of inventory, thus forcing a partial delivery, and new inventory is received within the exact same second. Under these conditions, the Deliver category reevaluates the orders to be delivered, which can result in the next delivery being inserted into the Orders pool before the previous order is reinserted. 
</p><p><a name="1000763"></a>
<li>If a dialog is currently showing and you display a menu from the menu bar such that it overlaps the dialog, the menu appears behind the dialog, instead of in front of it. You must move or close the dialog so that it no longer obstructs the menu.
</p></ul><a name="1000154">
<h1> Documentation Errata</h1>
</a><ul><p><a name="1002801"></a>
<li>In Chapter 18, "Using the Scenario Manager" in the section "Resource Parameter Keywords," the <code>SET-RESOURCE-CAPACITY</code> keyword is incorrectly documented. The correct syntax for this keyword is:
</p><ul><a name="1002802"></a>
<pre>SET-RESOURCE-CAPACITY(&lt;plant-label&gt;, &lt;new-value&gt;, &lt;time&gt;)</pre>
</ul></ul><ul><p><a name="1002803"></a>
Also, the example for this keyword is incorrect. It should be:
</p><ul><a name="1002804"></a>
<pre>SET-RESOURCE-CAPACITY(headquarters,10,0)</pre>
</ul></ul><ul><p><a name="1000167"></a>
<li>The description of the Asset Turns metric for a role currently reads:
</p><ul><p><a name=1000263"></a>
The number of days the role takes to turn over its inventory for delivery products, measured as a cost-weighted value in days.
</p>
</ul></ul><ul><p><a name="1000288"></a>
This definition is not correct. Asset Turns is not measured in days; it is measured as a dollar value. The correct description should read:
</p><ul><p><a name=1000306"></a>
The number of days the role takes to turn over its inventory for delivery products, measured as a cost-weighted value.
</p>
</ul><p><a name="1000316"></a>
The formula in Appendix A "Asset Metrics Formulas" of the <em>e-SCOR User's Guide</em> is correct.
</p></ul><ul><p><a name="1001106"></a>
<li>The FAX number on the copyright page of the e-SCOR online documentation is incorrect in certain books. The correct FAX number for Gensym is: (781) 265-7101.
</p><p><a name="1001107"></a>
<li>The Customer Support FAX number in the Preface of the online documentation is incorrect. The correct Customer Support FAX number is: (781) &#32;265-7255.
</p></ul><a name="1000265">
<h1> Starting e-SCOR</h1>
</a><p><a name="1000266"></a>
e-SCOR is a client/server application. In general, to start e-SCOR, you can simply start the client, then respond to the prompt to automatically start and connect to the server running on the local host computer at port 1111. The installation program creates shortcuts in the e-SCOR program group on the Start menu for starting both the server and the client. 
</p>
<p><a name="34746"></a>
By default, when you start e-SCOR, e-SCOR opens the default model into the server, which is escor.kb. The next time you start e-SCOR, e-SCOR opens the last saved model. 
</p>
<p><a name="34749"></a>
You can open a different model at startup by creating and modifying a shortcut to the e-SCOR Server. To start e-SCOR with a different model opened, first, you start the server, then you start the client. 
</p>
<p><a name="34752"></a>
The server runs as a hidden process, which you can view on the Processes tab of the Task Manager by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Del and clicking the Task Manager button. The server process appears in the list as <code>g2.exe</code>. 
</p>
<p><a name="34755"></a>
<strong>To open the default e-SCOR model: 
</strong></dt></p><ul><p><a name="34756"></a>
-> Choose Start &gt; Programs &gt; Gensym e-SCOR &amp; ReThink &gt; e-SCOR Client, then click Yes to start and connect to the e-SCOR server on the local machine at port 1111. 
</p></ul><p><a name="34759"></a>
The splash screen provides status updates as the server is launching, which can take more than a minute, depending on the speed of your computer. 
</p>
<p><a name="34762"></a>
<strong>To start e-SCOR with a different model opened in the server: 
</strong></dt></p><ol><a name="34764"></a>
<li value="1	">Create a shortcut to the Server.bat file located in the bin directory of your e-SCOR product directory. <p>
<a name="36912"></a>
<li value="2	">Display the properties dialog for the shortcut, click the Shortcut tab, and add the default KB file to open, following the path name in the Target field, for example: <p>
<ul><p><a name=34768"></a>
<code>"C:\Program Files\Gensym\escor_rethink\bin\Server.bat" <br>escor-demos.kb</code>
</p>
</ul><a name="34770"></a>
<li value="3	">Double-click the shortcut to start the server from the new batch file. <p>
<a name="36968"></a>
<li value="4	">Choose e-SCOR Client from the Start menu to start the client, which automatically connects to the server. <p>
</ol><a name="34773">
<h1> Exiting e-SCOR</h1>
</a><p><a name="34775"></a>
When you exit the client, ReThink prompts you to exit the server as well. In general, you should exit the server as well as the client. If you do not exit the server when you exit the client, logging out of your Windows session exits the server automatically.
</p>
<p><a name="34779"></a>
<hr><strong>Caution:</strong> Be sure to save your application before you exit ReThink.<hr>
</p><p><a name="34781"></a>
<strong>To exit ReThink:
</strong></dt></p><ol><a name="34783"></a>
<li value="1	">In the client, choose File &gt; Exit. <p>
<a name="34784"></a>
<li value="2	">In the confirmation dialog that appears, click Yes to exit the server as well. <p>
</ol><p><a name="34786"></a>
If you do not exit the server at the same time, you must exit the server manually.
</p>
<p><a name="34787"></a>
<strong>To exit the ReThink server: 
</strong></dt></p><ol><a name="34789"></a>
<li value="1	">Choose File &gt; Exit. <p>
<a name="37036"></a>
<li value="2	">In the confirmation dialog that appears, click the Shutdown button. <p>

<h1> Upgrading Models</h1>
</a><p><a name="999150"></a>
There are two aspects to upgrading your models:
</p>
<ul><p><a name="999155"></a>
<li>Upgrading roles and categories to use the new definitions.
</p><p><a name="999196"></a>
<li>Upgrading Version 2.1 models to use the new parameters for configuring the Mode Type of a category.
</p></ul><a name="999131">
<h2> Upgrading Roles and Categories</h2>
</a><p><a name="34922"></a>
Before you can run an existing e-SCOR model, you must upgrade the model to use the new e-SCOR definitions. By default, when you upgrade existing models, all roles and categories are upgraded. This is because, by default, the Upgrade parameter for all roles and categories is "on".
</p>
<p><a name="34926"></a>
<hr><strong>Caution:</strong> If you have customized any portion of your model and you do not want to replace your existing definitions with the new e-SCOR definitions, click the Upgrade option "off" for the specific role and/or category whose definition you wish to preserve. However, note that if you do not choose to upgrade, your model will use old definitions, which can cause problems when running your model.<hr>
</p><p><a name="34931"></a>
For example, you might have added S2, M2, D2, S3, M3, and/or D3 categories to the role detail to model alternative planning strategies, or you might have added custom blocks to a category detail to customize the behavior of the model at Level 3 or Level 4 SCOR. If so, you may wish to retain these changes and upgrade your model manually later.
</p>
<p><a name="34934"></a>
The Update option has different meanings for roles and categories, as follows:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<strong>Upgrade "on" means...</strong>
<tr><td valign="middle"><p><a name="39503"></a>
Role
</p>
<td valign="middle"><p><a name="39544"></a>
Upgrade the configuration of the categories on the role detail, that is, which categories appear. 
</p>

<tr><td valign="middle"><p><a name="39550"></a>
Category
</p>
<td valign="middle"><p><a name="39600"></a>
Upgrade the implementation of Level 3 and Level 4 SCOR on the category detail, that is, the e-SCOR custom blocks and the ReThink blocks and instruments that appear on the category detail. 
</p>

<strong>To preserve the configuration of the categories that appear on the role detail, but replace the Level 3 and Level 4 implementation of those categories, using the new definitions: 
</strong></dt></p><ol><a name="34947"></a>
<li value="1	">Click the Upgrade option "off" for the role whose definition you wish to retain. <p>
<a name="39650"></a>
<li value="2	">Leave the Upgrade option for each category on the role detail "on". <p>
</ol><p><a name="34950"></a>
<strong>To replace the configuration of the categories that appear on the role detail, using the new definition, but retain the implementation of those categories:
</strong></dt></p><ol><a name="34953"></a>
<li value="1	">Leave the Upgrade option for the role detail "on". <p>
<a name="39680"></a>
<li value="2	">Click the Upgrade option "off" for each category on the role detail whose definition you wish to retain. <p>
</ol><p><a name="34956"></a>
Upgrading existing models applies to all roles in the current model, regardless of the workspace on which the role appears and regardless of whether the model is disabled.
</p>
<p><a name="999090"></a>
<strong>To upgrade role details when the upgrade option is off:
</strong></dt></p><ol><a name="999091"></a>
<li value="1	">For each role whose Upgrade option is off, show the details of the role. <p>
<a name="999092"></a>
<li value="2	">Delete the blue input and output paths connected to the P2 and P3 categories, then delete the remaining stubs. <p>
<a name="999093"></a>
<li value="3	">Show the details of the P2 and P3 blocks and delete the two connection stubs on the details that are no longer connected. <p>
<a name="999094"></a>
<li value="4	">Move the P2 block above the SU Router (before the S1 block) and within the Source text box. <p>
<a name="999095"></a>
<li value="5	">Move the P3 block above the MU Router (before the M1 block) and within the Make text box. <p>
<a name="999096"></a>
<li value="6	">Replace the category router copy block (triangle in icon) in front of the D1 block with a category router branch block (diamond in icon) by copying the new router and dropping it on top of the existing router. <p>
<a name="999097"></a>
<li value="7	">Copy the category router branch block from the input path to the Source and Make category blocks on the role detail. <p>
<a name="999098"></a>
<li value="8	">To see how the details are supposed to look, create a new role from the palette and view its details. <p>

<h2> Upgrading e-SCOR Version 2.1 Models to e-SCOR Version 4.0</h2>
</a><p><a name="34958"></a>
If you are currently running e-SCOR Version 2.1 or earlier and you are upgrading to e-SCOR Version 4.0, you must upgrade the parameters that allow you to configure the Mode Type of a category to be any one of a number of mathematical distributions. To do this, you use the <code>escor-upgrade.kb</code>, as the following instructions describe. 
</p>
<p><a name="999060"></a>
<hr><strong>Note:</strong> These upgrade instructions apply to e-SCOR Version 2.1 models only.<hr>
</p><p><a name="34961"></a>
<strong>To upgrade your model: 
</strong></dt></p><ol><a name="34963"></a>
<li value="1	">In e-SCOR Version 2.1, open the KB file for the model you want to upgrade. <p>
<a name="39722"></a>
<li value="2	">Determine which roles and/or categories in the model you do not wish to upgrade and click the Upgrade option off for those objects. <p>
<a name="39719"></a>
<li value="3	">Choose File Modules Merge to merge the KB named <code>escor-upgrade.kb</code>, located in the e-SCOR Version 4.0 <code>kbs</code> directory. <p>
<a name="39738"></a>
<li value="4	">On the e-SCOR Upgrade Data workspace, click the Save Block Values button. <p>
</ol><ul><p><a name="39744"></a>
Saving block values generates a <code>.dat</code> file with the same name as the top-level module, which includes all the relevant role, category, and product composite parameters that need to be upgraded. 
</p><p><a name="40078"></a>
The file is created in the directory from which you opened the KB file. 
</p></ul><ol><a name="39758"></a>
<li value="5	">Copy the KB file to upgrade and the <code>.dat</code> file from the e-SCOR Version 2.1 <code>kbs</code> directory to the e-SCOR Version 4.0 <code>kbs</code> directory. <p>
<a name="39767"></a>
<li value="6	">In e-SCOR Version 4.0, choose File &gt; Open, enter the name of the KB file to upgrade, and enable the Automatically Resolve Conflicts option on the Options tab. <p>
</ol><ul><p><a name="34975"></a>
<hr><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to open your KB to upgrade so that it automatically resolves conflicts; otherwise, errors will result. <hr>
</p></ul><ol><a name="34976"></a>
<li value="7	">Merge the <code>escor-upgrade.kb</code> file located in the e-SCOR Version 4.0 <code>kbs</code> directory. <p>
<a name="39802"></a>
<li value="8	">On the e-SCOR Upgrade Data workspace, click the Restore Block Values button. <p>
</ol><ul><p><a name="34978"></a>
Upgrading data loads the <code>.dat</code> file with the same name as the top-level module, using all the relevant role, category, and product composite parameters, then automatically upgrades the rest of the model, based on the new role and category definitions. 
</p></ul><ol><a name="34981"></a>
<li value="9	">Choose File Modules Delete to delete the <code>escor-upgrade</code> module from the model before you save. <p>
<a name="39834"></a>
<li value="10	">Save the top-level module, which is now compatible with e-SCOR Version 4.0. <p>
<a name="39837"></a>
<li value="11	">If you have any roles whose Upgrade option is off, you must manually upgrade the role details to remove extra paths and replace routers, as described below. <p>
