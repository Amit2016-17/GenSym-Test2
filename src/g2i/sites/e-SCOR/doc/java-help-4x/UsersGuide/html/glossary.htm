<p><b>Make Planning process</b>: A process in which a Base Manufacturer and Manufacturer role plans when to make delivery products. The Make Planning process initiates on a regular planning cycle and triggers the Build process.<a name="7603"></a></p>
<p><b>Make category</b>: A Level 2 category that manufactures finished products and places them into inventory.<a name="7605"></a></p>
<p><b>Manufacturer role</b>: A Level 1 role that sources components from upstream suppliers, manufactures finished products, and delivers finished products to downstream buyers. A Manufacturer role uses make planning to determine when to make finished products and how much to make. A Manufacturer role requires a resource. <a name="7607"></a></p>
<p><b>metric</b>: A value that e-SCOR computes during the simulation. e-SCOR provides a number of SCOR metrics, as well as a number of e-SCOR metrics.<a name="7609"></a></p>

<h4 >O<a name="800"></a></h4><p><b>Order/Product process</b>: A process in which a buyer sends orders to a supplier for source products, and a supplier processes and fulfills those orders by sending product shipments to buyers. The Order/Product process initiates based on customer orders from the Consumer role or replenishment orders from the Source Planning process. The Order/Product process triggers the Financial process when products are shipped to buyers. The Build process can also initiate the process of selecting orders for shipment when finished products become available from manufacturing.<a name="7625"></a></p>
<h4 >P<a name="802"></a></h4><p><b>parameter</b>: A value that you enter into the model as a variable. e-SCOR provides a number of SCOR metrics as parameters, as well as a number of e-SCOR parameters.<a name="7646"></a></p>
<p><b>Plan category</b>: A Level 2 category that plans supply and demand cycles in the supply chain. The two Plan categories are P2: Plan Source, which is responsible for creating replenishment orders for source products, and P3: Plan Make, which is responsible for creating build orders for delivery products.<a name="7648"></a></p>
<p><b>planning mode</b>: Determines whether a role uses pull or push planning to source and deliver its products. A buyer can source products by placing orders with suppliers (pull) or simply receive products from suppliers when the role delivers them (push). A supplier can deliver products, based on orders (pull) or simply deliver a specified number of finished products (push).<a name="8780"></a></p>
<p><b>planning strategy: </b>Determines how a role computes order size and determines to whom it delivers products. The available planning strategies are: stock/replenishment, stock/forecast, make-to-order, and engineer-to-order.<a name="7650"></a></p>
<p><b>pool</b>: An object on the role detail in which e-SCOR stores permanent objects, such as product composites, and transient objects, such as orders.<a name="8647"></a></p>

<p><b>product hierarchy</b>: A hierarchical representation of the products that a supply chain sources, makes, and delivers. The product hierarchy consists of a high-level product specification, which is a finished product, and one or more lower-level product specifications, which are components. Components, in turn, can consist of other components.<a name="7656"></a></p>
<p><b>product specification</b>: A representation of each product in the product hierarchy. You assign a product specification to each role in the model to determine the products the role sources and/or delivers, which creates product composites in the Products pool.<a name="7658"></a></p>
<p><b>pull planning mode</b>: A buyer sources products from suppliers by placing orders, and a supplier delivers finished products to buyers, based on those orders. <a name="9128"></a></p>
<p><b>push planning mode</b>: A supplier pushes a fixed number of products onto buyers, and a buyer simply receives those products from suppliers when the supplier pushes them.<a name="9130"></a></p>
<h4 >R<a name="806"></a></h4><p><b>replenishment order</b>: A customer order for the source product of a Distributor or Manufacturer role, used to replenish the inventory of source products.<a name="7674"></a></p>
<p><b>replenishment planning strategy</b>: See stock/replenishment planning strategy. <a name="7676"></a></p>
<p><b>resource</b>: A representation of the capacity a role has for manufacturing finished products. Base Manufacturer and Manufacturer roles require resources.<a name="7678"></a></p>
<p><b>role</b>: An abstraction of the management processes implicit in Level 2 SCOR, which describes the scope and content of the overall supply chain. A role consists of sets of Plan-Source-Make-Deliver processes. You create and connect roles to form a supply-chain model. You assign product specifications to roles to create source and delivery products. You assign resources to roles that manufacture finished products. The Level 1 roles are: Base Manufacturer role, Distributor role, Manufacturer role, and Consumer role.<a name="8327"></a></p>
<p><b>Role Verification process</b>: A process in which buyers determine available suppliers for source products. The Role Verification process also coordinates pull and push planning. The process initiates when the model starts and takes 2 seconds of simulation time.<a name="8324"></a></p>
<p><b>router</b>: An object that you place between roles when connecting a single role to multiple roles. The router sends appropriate objects to appropriate roles.<a name="7682"></a></p>
