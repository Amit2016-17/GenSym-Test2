Examples of Configuring the Source Category for Choosing Suppliers
</h2>
<p>To illustrate how the model can choose among multiple suppliers when contracts are in effect, suppose you have three qualified suppliers for a given product, Supplier A, Supplier B, and Supplier C. The Supplier Preference of the delivery product associated with each supplier is 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Suppose you are issuing awards, based first on Total Cost, then on Supplier Preference parameter.<a name="53680"></a></p>
<p>Suppose you want to issue awards to two suppliers, where the primary supplier gets the order 75% of the time and the secondary supplier gets the order 25% of the time. Assume Supplier A offers the lowest cost product, based on the Net Selling Price of the supplier's delivery product. Assuming Split Order is "off," the default, the order goes to Supplier A 75% of the time, based on product cost and to Supplier B 25% of the time, based on product cost. <a name="53681"></a></p>
<p>The following figure illustrates this situation, where the dotted lines indicate that the process category blocks are connected indirectly through roles:<a name="53682"></a></p>

</p>
<p>This example shows a similar situation in which the buyer issues awards to three suppliers, where two suppliers have the same Net Selling Price. In this case, the buyer sorts suppliers, based on the secondary sort attribute, which is Supplier Preference. The buyer places orders with a single supplier, based on probabilities.<a name="53741"></a></p>

</p>
<p>Suppose you decide to split the order among three qualified suppliers, so you configure Split Order to be "on" and Number of Suppliers as <code>3</code>. In this case, the Proportion parameters determine the proportion of the order that each supplier receives. Suppose you have specified the Proportion parameters such that 50% of the order should go to the first supplier, 30% should go to second supplier, and 20% should go to the third supplier. If Supplier A has the lowest product cost and Suppliers B and C have the same product cost, the buyer gives 50% of the order to Supplier A, based on cost, 30% of the order to Supplier B, based on preference, and 20% of the order to Supplier C, based on preference.<a name="53800"></a></p>
