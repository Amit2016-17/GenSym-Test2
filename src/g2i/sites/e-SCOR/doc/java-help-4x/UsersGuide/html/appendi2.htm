Days of Supply
</h2>
<p>The Days of Supply metrics are measured in days of supply of inventory for source products, work in progress, delivery products, and total inventory. The metrics include Days of Supply for <i>all</i> source products, delivery products, and work in progress for the role.<a name="20584"></a></p>
<p>The Days of Supply metrics are cost-weighted values, based on the Purchase Cost metric for source products and the Net Selling Price parameter for delivery products. The Days of Supply metrics assume the Purchase Cost and Net Selling Price are both non-zero. If you are not concerned with costs in the model, configure these parameters to be <code>1</code>; otherwise, the Days of Supply metrics will be zero.<a name="20632"></a></p>
<p>The Days of Supply metrics assume the Inventory Level metric for a source or delivery product is non-zero; otherwise, the Days of Supply metrics will be zero.<a name="20614"></a></p>
<p>The Days of Supply metrics assume the role consumes a certain amount of source or delivery products during the current financial period. If the consumption is zero for a given financial period, the Days of Supply metrics will equal infinity, implying that the role has an infinite supply for the financial period.<a name="20617"></a></p>
<p>A consumption of zero has different effects on the <b>Inventory</b> Days of Supply and <b>Cash-to-Cash Cycle Time</b> metrics.<a name="26115"></a></p>
<h6><b>Caution: </b>A value of infinite appears in a dialog as the symbol inf; however, a value of 
infinite appears in a report as 65,536 or 216. Be sure to take into account infinite 
numbers when interpreting results in Excel reports, for example, when averaging 
values over time.
<a name="26209"></a></h6><p>e-SCOR computes the Days of Supply metrics, based on a time-weighted average of actual values over time. This means the e-SCOR Days of Supply metrics are more accurate than standard computations for Days of Supply, which normally use averages based on samples taken during the financial period. <a name="20626"></a></p>
