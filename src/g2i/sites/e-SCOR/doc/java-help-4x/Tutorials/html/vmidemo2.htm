Case Study: Business Problem
</h2>
<p>A regional supplier of medical supplies and drugs is trying to convince its customers that it can save them money by taking ownership of their stock and managing their resupply. The Just-in-time Medical Supplies (JMS) Co. wants to show three customers, the Saint Augustine Hospital, Bearly Legal Drugs, and Cold Storage Nursing Home, how much it can reduce inventory and associated costs while maintaining adequate safety stock at each location. JMS also wants to know how much it can reduce its own inventory if it can deliver supplies to them more often.<a name="286455"></a></p>
<p>JMS must show its customers the minimum inventory everyone must carry to meet their normal and worst case scenarios. Senior management wants this information in terms of days of supply and other standard asset calculations.<a name="286456"></a></p>
<p>If JMS were to take over control of the customer's stock, they think that they could cut normal delivery time in half due to simpler delivery schedules. They need to determine what effect this strategy would have on their assets.<a name="286457"></a></p>
