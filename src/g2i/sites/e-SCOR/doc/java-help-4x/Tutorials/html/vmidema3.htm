<p>Did your replenishment level estimates result in 100% on-time performance? No, they were no where near sufficient to meet the demand. For example, your Level 2 Output Report might have values something like these: <a name="281373"></a></p>
<p >
  <a name="281415"> </a>
<p><div align="left"><img src="images/tutoriad.gif" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0">
</div><a name="281414"></a></p>



</p>
<p>In this simulation, neither the three consumers nor the distribution sites had anywhere close to 100% Supplier On-Time Performance. <a name="281430"></a></p>
<p>Now, let's look at inventory days of supply and assets. For example, your Role Output Report might have values something like these: <a name="282611"></a></p>
<p >
  <a name="282631"> </a>
<p><div align="left"><img src="images/tutorie2.gif" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0">
</div><a name="282630"></a></p>



</p>
<p>In this simulation, the distribution sites are carrying less than one day of inventory, which is way too low. The sites take between 0 and 168 days to turn over their inventory. Two of the three sites spend more money than they take in, based on a positive cash-to-cash cycle time. Therefore, the asset metrics for the three distribution sites, as well as for the central distributor, are not very favorable, because the amount of inventory is not sufficient to supply all sites equally well, based on demand.<a name="281507"></a></p>
<p>To increase on-time performance and balance asset metrics between the sites, you need to increase replenishment levels, which you will experiment with <a href="../../../GettingStartedTutorial/chapters/vmidemoo.htm#VMIOptimizing">later in this tutorial</a>.<a name="282675"></a></p>
