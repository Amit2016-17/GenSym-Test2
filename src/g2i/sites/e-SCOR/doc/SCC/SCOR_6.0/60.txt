Version 6.0 of the SCOR-model is the sixth major revision since the Model’s introduction in 1996.  
Revisions of the Model are made when it is determined by Council members that changes should 
be made to facilitate the use of the Model in practice.  The Metrics Committee added clarification 
indicating that Level 1 Metrics do not necessarily relate to Level 1 Processes in Version 6.0 and 
the rest of their work will be incorporated into Version 7.0.

In Version 6.0, there are three primary areas of change:

1) The Deliver processes have been expanded to include a new Level 2 category, D4 - Deliver Retail Product.  
This addition addresses the unique activities and sequence of activities associated with delivering a product 
(normally to a consumer). 

2) R2 - Return of Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) Product, has been rewritten.  
The processes associated with the Return of MRO products (SR2, MR2) have been updated for ease of use.  
The processes and their associated definitions have been clarified.  In this version of the Model, 
only the SR2 and DR2 elements have been revised.  In the next version of the Model the revisions 
are anticipated to extend to the SR1, DR1, SR3, and DR3 processes.

3) eBusiness best practices have been included in the Make processes continuing an update of best practice, 
which was initiated in Version 5.0 of the Model.
