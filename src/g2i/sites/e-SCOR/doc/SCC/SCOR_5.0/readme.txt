Supply Chain Operations Reference-model (SCOR) 5.0 

Introduction

	Version 5.0 of the SCOR-model is the fifth major revision since the Model's introduction in 1996.  This version of the Model extends the Return processes that were introduced in Version 4.0.  Additionally, this Model release begins the introduction of eBusiness best practice and begins a major restructuring of the metrics that is planned be continued in Version 6.0. 

The Model is the product of the Supply-Chain Council (SCC), an independent, not-for-profit, global corporation with membership open to all companies and organizations interested in applying and advancing the state-of-the-art in supply-chain management systems and practices.  The SCC was organized in 1996 by Pittiglio Rabin Todd & McGrath (PRTM) and AMR Research, and initially included 69 voluntary member companies.  At the time of this release, the Council has approximately 750 members worldwide and has established international chapters in Europe, Japan, Korea, Latin America, Australia/New Zealand and Southeast Asia with additional requests for regional chapters pending.  The majority of the SCC's members are practitioners and represents a broad cross-section of industries, including manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.  Equally important to the Council and the advancement of the SCOR-model are the technology suppliers and implementers, the academicians, and the government organizations that participate in Council activities and the development and maintenance of the Model.

	The Supply-Chain Council is interested in providing the widest possible dissemination of the SCOR-model.  The wide-spread use of the Model results in better customer-supplier relationships, software systems that can better support members through the use of common measurements and terms, and the ability to rapidly recognize and adopt best practice no matter where it originates.  SCC requests that all who use the SCOR-model provide attribution to the Supply-Chain Council.  Additionally, members are encouraged to monitor the members section of the SCC website to ensure that they are using the latest version of SCOR. 

	An introduction is provided to assist new users of the SCOR-model as well as experienced users in understanding and applying the Model to realize supply chain improvements.  It is also provided to orient members to the changes between Version 5.0 and its predecessor.
