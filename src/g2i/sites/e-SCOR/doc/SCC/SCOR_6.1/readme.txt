Version 6.1 of the SCOR-model is the seventh major revision since the Model’s introduction in 1996.  Revisions of the Model are made when it is determined by Council members that changes should be made to facilitate the use of the Model in practice.  In Version 6.1, there are two primary areas of change: 

1) Returns – The principal changes to the SCOR Model in this revision are in the area of returns.  These changes reflect the results of continued validation of the Return processes by Council members.  The Returns processes have been modified in several ways:
	a. Level 2 process changes.  The Model has been updated to provide a clear delineation between Source Return process and Deliver Return processes.  Level 2 Return processes have been updated to include identified Enable processes and candidate metrics.  
	b. Level 3 process changes.  Level 3 process changes in all of the Return product categories (Defective Product, Maintenance Repair and Overhaul Product, and Excess Product) have been revised.  Level 3 processes have been changed and modified; the sequence of Level 3 processes has been changed (primarily in SR1, SR3, DR1, and DR3.  Additionally, enable elements, metrics references / definitions, and inputs and outputs have been identified.

2) Best Practices – Following the release of Version 6.0, the Supply Chain Council began an initiative to update best practices within the Model.  This version of the Model begins that update with the inclusion of a new definition of Best Practice and the addition of best practices in:
·	Collaborative Planning Forecasting and Replenishment
·	Sales and Operations Planning
·	Supplier Assessment
·	Supplier Carrier Agreements
