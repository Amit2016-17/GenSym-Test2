<h4 >A<a name="16275"></a></h4><p><b>allocate</b>: To assign a resource to an activity. By default, Resource Managers allocate resources to activities at random. You can customize how a particular Resource Manager allocates resources to an activity.<a name="16340"></a></p>
<p><b>animation subtable: </b>A subobject that defines the default colors and animation procedure for a block, work object, resource, instrument, Resource Manager, surrogate, or path.<a name="16342"></a></p>
<p><b>application programmers' interface (API)</b>: Internal ReThink procedures that you use to customize objects. You use these procedures to perform actions on ReThink objects programmatically.<a name="23200"></a></p>
<p><b>association object</b>: An internal object that ReThink creates when an Associate block evaluates. ReThink creates relations between the association object and the associated objects.<a name="16344"></a></p>
<h4 >B<a name="16277"></a></h4><p><b>block processing</b>: The actions that ReThink performs when a block evaluates. During block processing, ReThink establishes relations between objects, computes cost and duration statistics for objects, animates objects, allocates and deallocates resources, and activates instruments. When you customize ReThink, it is essential to understand the order in which these events take place so that you can write your methods and procedures accordingly.<a name="16362"></a></p>
<p><b>bpr</b> <b>module</b>: The proprietary core of ReThink. This module contains the discrete event simulation engine and other internal mechanisms that are fundamental to the ReThink environment. It also contains the default layout of the ReThink menus.<a name="16363"></a></p>
<h4 >C<a name="16279"></a></h4><p><b>class-specific attributes</b>: The attributes of a class that are specific to that class. When you customize ReThink objects, you can add class-specific attributes to custom classes. Typically, you refer to these attributes in the custom methods and procedures that determine the behavior of the object.<a name="16386"></a></p>
<p><b>cost subtable:</b> Subobject that determines the default procedure that computes total cost for blocks, resources, and work objects.<a name="22813"></a></p>
<p><b>customiz</b> <b>module</b>: The module in which you create and save customizations to ReThink objects, when you plan on sharing these customizations across different applications of ReThink. <a name="22774"></a></p>
<p><b>customization</b>: The ability to create ReThink objects that are specific to your particular business process. As a ReThink developer, you can customize such things as the way a ReThink object behaves, the way it looks or animates, the way it computes duration, and the way it computes cost. To customize ReThink, you must be in Developer mode.<a name="16389"></a></p>
<h4 >D<a name="16281"></a></h4><p><b>deallocate</b>: To release a resource assigned to an activity. You can customize how a particular Resource Manager deallocates resources from an activity.<a name="16402"></a></p>
<p><b>developer</b>: A ReThink user who uses G2, Gensym's core technology upon which ReThink is built, to create custom ReThink objects. Developers create new ReThink objects that are specific to a particular application and are based on existing ReThink objects. Developers work in Developer mode. <a name="18246"></a></p>
<p><b>Developer mode</b>: The user mode in which you customize ReThink. In Developer mode, the tables for ReThink objects include customization attributes, and the menus include customization menu choices. <a name="16403"></a></p>
<p><b>duration subtable</b>: Subobject that defines the default procedure that computes duration and utilization statistics for blocks, resources, and work objects. The default duration of most blocks is computed based on a random normal function and represents the amount of simulation time the block has been processing work objects. The duration of a resource is the amount of simulation time the resource has been allocated to activities in the model. The duration of a work object is the amount of simulation time the blocks in the model have spent processing the work object.<a name="16404"></a></p>
<h4 >G<a name="16287"></a></h4><p><b>G2 Foundation Resources (GFR) module</b>: A G2 module that provides the text resource group and local text resources that you edit when you customize the ReThink menus. <a name="16437"></a></p>
<h4 >M<a name="22431"></a></h4><p><b>methods</b> <b>module</b>: The module that contains the class definitions for ReThink objects and subobjects, and the methods and procedures that control their behavior. When you customize ReThink, you create subclasses of these class definitions and copy these methods and procedures. You should not edit the definitions in the <code>methods</code> module, otherwise your edits will be overwritten when you upgrade to a new version of ReThink.<a name="16490"></a></p>
<h4 >P<a name="16305"></a></h4><p><b>posting:</b> Locating an output path of the correct type for a work object and setting the work object onto the path. <a name="16522"></a></p>
<h4 >R<a name="16309"></a></h4><p><b>relation</b>: A type of association between two objects that is not visible. ReThink creates a number of relations at various stages in block processing, as well as when you create various types of ReThink objects. The methods and procedures you customize make frequent use of these relations.<a name="16541"></a></p>
<p><b>rethink</b> <b>module</b>: The top-level ReThink module in which you create your ReThink applications when you have licensed ReThink Offline.<a name="19730"></a></p>
<p><b>rethink-online</b> <b>module</b>: The top-level ReThink module in which you create your ReThink applications when you have licensed ReThink Online.<a name="28836"></a></p>
<h4 >S<a name="16311"></a></h4><p><b>start method</b>: A method that a block executes before its duration and before it executes the stop method. You can customize the start method of a subclass of ReThink block to provide custom behavior.<a name="16559"></a></p>
<p><b>stop method</b>: A method that defines the default behavior of a block or instrument. You can customize the stop method of a subclass of a ReThink block or instrument to provide custom behavior.<a name="16560"></a></p>
<p><b>subclass</b>: A class of objects that inherits part of its definition from another class of object. When a ReThink model processes work objects, ReThink automatically creates subclasses of the built-in <code>bpr-object</code> class when you specify the output path type to be a user-defined object. In addition, when you customize ReThink, you define subclasses of ReThink classes, whose icon, attributes, methods, procedures, and subobjects you customize.<a name="16561"></a></p>
<p><b>subobject</b>: The value of an attribute that contains an object. ReThink objects define three types of subobjects: animation subobjects, duration subobjects, and cost subobjects, all of which you can customize. The type of subobjects that an object defines depends on the type of object.<a name="16562"></a></p>
<p><b>superior class</b>: The class from which a subclass inherits. You can specify any ReThink block, instrument, work object, or resource class as the superior class of a custom class.<a name="16563"></a></p>
<h4 >U<a name="16315"></a></h4><p><b>usage object</b>: An internal object that ReThink creates to track the utilization of current resources. ReThink creates relations between usage objects and resources, Resource Managers, and activities. A usage object is related to a Resource Manager in the same way that an activity is related to a block.<a name="16590"></a></p>
