                     ReThink 3.1 Rev. 0 Change Log
                     =============================

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  Changed the version to "3.1 Rev. 0 Development".

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Modified the procedures bpr-random-available-resource, bpr-lowest-    AvailableResource.kb
  cost-available-resource, bpr-lowest-utilization-available-resource,   Case 1 - 5
  bpr-highest-priority-available-resource, and bpr-lowest-priority-
  available-resource to take availability, based upon temporal
  constraints, into account when allocating resources. So the first
  available resource will always be allocated if no resources are
  available due to other allocations or temporal constraints.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  Modified the resource allocation procedures mentioned above to fix a  AvailableResource.kb
  problem with the wrong resource being selected when one of the        Case 6 - 10
  resources is available.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  Fixed the code in the procedure bpr-find-not-available-time-in-       TemporalConstraint.kb
  interval which calculates the not available time for a resource.      TCResourceStatistics Test
  This code was not working properly after the temporal constraint
  fixes implemented earlier in the 3.0 Rev. 1 release.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Modified the procedure bpr-activate-next-usage and added the          AvailableResource.kb
  procedures bpr-check-for-waiting-resources and bpr-switch-waiting-    Case 11
  resource to potentially switch resources when a resource becomes
  available. So if a resource is waiting on its temporal constraint
  and another resource becomes available, the activity will be
  switched to the available resource.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

? Added code to the method bpr-stop-method of the sample and average    NewInstrument.kb
  probes to support connecting them to quantitative parameters and      Case 1 - 2
  variables. Rules were also added to update the sample and average
  probes whenever the value of the quantitative parameter or variable
  changes. This allows quantitative parameters and variables to be
  charted over time.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  Modified the procedures bpr-set-source-attribute-name and bpr-set-    NewInstrument.kb
  destination-attribute-name to correctly clear the subtable name and   Case 3
  attribute name when the no source or destination attribute name,
  respectively, is specified.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Integrated my previous work on re-implementing all of the dialogs     ???
  using the UIL tab dialogs. All of the dialogs now have a slightly
  different look. The one other noticeable difference for users is
  that the previously selected tab now comes up selected by default
  (rather than always coming up with the first tab selected). Note
  that we are also now using scheduled drawing, as this is required by
  the UIL tab dialogs. This work also involved separating all of the
  dialog code into a new BPRUI module, which is implemented using the
  new Gensym coding standards.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the animation-speed attribute to the scenario and created a     ???
  user interface for it. The Set Scenario dialog now has a new
  Animation tab which has a spin control for the animation speed, as
  well as the enable animation control which used to be on the
  Scenario tab.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the capability to associate together two connectors on          MultipleModules.kb
  different detail workspaces so that work objects can be sent across   Case 1 - 2
  those detail workspaces even though the higher level task blocks are
  not necessarily connected. This required the addition of a choose-
  connector menu choice on connectors and some modifications to the
  show-path menu choice.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

? Updated the scenario start time to be January 1, 1998 by default,
  rather than 1997. Also updated the copyright to include 1998 on the
  About ReThink... workspace.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the capability to associate a detail workspace (other than the  MultipleModules.kb
  subworkspace) with the model and organizer objects. This required     Case 3 - 4
  the addition of the show-detail (in place of the go-to-subworkspace
  menu choice) and choose-detail menu choices for these objects.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added an Animation tab page to support changing the icon colors in    ???
  modeler mode for all of the objects that have an animation subtable.
  This consists of blocks, paths, resources, surrogates, and
  instruments.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Enhanced the copy block to optionally also add to the associations    customadds.kb
  of the original work object. The set block dialog for the copy block
  now has an add to associations toggle button.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Enhanced the associate block to operate in one of three different     customadds.kb
  modes; new, add, or remove. New mode is the original associate block
  operated, add mode adds the input work object to an existing
  association, and remove mode removes the input work object from an
  existing association.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added a show-associations user menu choice on work objects to show    ???
  the associated work objects. This uses the bpr-indicate procedure to
  show the associated work objects and makes the text be "Original"
  for the selected work object and the association name for all other
  work objects.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Enhanced the reconcile block to optionally reconcile only if all of   customadds.kb
  associated work objects are waiting at the block. The set block
  dialog for the reconcile block now has a reconcile all toggle
  button.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the Merge Module..., Rename Module..., Create Module..., and    ???
  Delete Module... menu choices under the File menu. Modules that are
  merged and created are automatically added to the module hierarchy
  as required by the top level module. Renaming a module changes all
  references to the module, both in the module hierarchy and for top
  level workspaces. Deleting a module also deletes all references to
  the module in the module hierarchy.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Enhanced the summary reports to support customizing the attributes    change-report-attributes.kb
  to be displayed in the report (and their order). This is done using
  the new edit attributes... user menu choice, which brings up a
  standard GXL editing workspace.

  - Usability Review 2/17/98 -----------------------------------------

* Added the efficiency factor attribute to the utilization tab of the   EfficiencyFactor.kb
  set resource dialog. This is a multiplier that allows the duration
  of a block to be modified based upon the resource selected.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the capability to have reports use Excel for the spreadsheet    ???
  (as an alternative to GXL). This required the addition of several
  new attributes to the set summary report dialog. The report mode
  attribute is used to indicate that Excel is to be used for the
  spreadsheet. The excel file name attribute specifies the name of the
  Excel spreadsheet which will be launched when the create report menu
  choice is selected. Finally, the report title attribute is used to
  specify which worksheet to use within the Excel spreadsheet.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Restructured the way reports are updated to support an update         ???
  interval, making them significantly more efficient. Visible changes
  to a user include the refresh report button is now called update
  report to more accurately reflect what it is doing and the update
  interval on the set report dialog. The update interval specifies an
  interval with which the report is automatically updated.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the load image... and delete image menu choices to the object   ???
  definition class. The load image... menu choice brings up a dialog
  which allows the user to specify an image file which is loaded into
  an image definition placed on the subworkspace of the object
  definition. The icon description attribute is also updated to use
  the image definition. The delete image menu choice removes the icon
  description and deletes the image definition. The show image menu
  choice previews the image on a workspace, which can be deleted by
  clicking anywhere on the workspace.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the sort ascending and sort descending buttons to the GXL       ???
  spreadsheet toolbar. These become enabled when a column is selected.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

? Changed the use of the id attribute for work objects. By default,     ???
  work objects are no longer assigned a unique id (since this added
  significant overhead to long simulations and was not required). The
  objects-require-unique-id attribute has been added to the scenario
  object, for backward compatibility.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Updated the database capabilities to work with the G2-Database 6.0    Database.kb
  API and class name changes. Users must use the 6.0 versions of the
  G2-Database bridges, as the older version will no longer work. The
  only user visible change is that all references to qo-record must be
  changed to db-qo-record.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

? Changed all of the references to the class g2-window to the class     ???
  ui-client-item, its parent class. This is required for Telewindows2
  and results in no visible change for modelers.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  Fixed numerous bugs in the new code to switch a waiting resource to   GensymCalendar.kb,
  an available resource which has been deallocated.                     SwitchWaitingResources.kb,
                                                                        BrucesTemporalConstraintTests.kb
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the capability to swap instruments and resources in the same    ???
  way that blocks can be swapped, by dropping a block on top of
  another block. Also added the make subclass menu choice (available
  in developer mode) for instruments and resources. This is basicly
  infrastructure work for the planned graphics enhancements.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the icon tool object, which allows you to easily transfer       ???
  images and icons to other objects, to the tools palette. The icon
  tool object has the load image... and delete image menu choices
  which are basicly identical as the same menu choices for object
  definitions. The one difference is that the icon tool changes its
  icon to be the image that has been loaded with the text "Icon Tool"
  in red letters on top of the image. The icon tool also provides the
  edit icon menu choice for invoking the icon editor. The icon tool
  can then be dropped on top of object definitions, blocks,
  instruments, and resources to change the icon of these objects to
  the icon of the icon tool (by invoking the make subclass menu choice
  for blocks, instruments, and resources).

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the images... menu item under the models menu for loading a     ???
  library of images. This menu item brings up a dialog for specifying
  a directory whose image files (*.gif and *.xbm) are to be loaded.
  The images are shown on a dynamic palette of icon tools, where the
  icon tools can be cloned like any object on a palette. Unlike
  standard palettes, the dynamic palette is actually deleted when the
  workspace label is selected. This provides the image capabilities
  without bloating the product and supports customers using their own
  image libraries.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the load image... and delete image menu choice capability for   ???
  workspaces. This works almost exactly the same as for object
  definitions, except that the image definition is simply placed on
  the workspace (but can be moved by the user).

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added icon text to the blocks and instruments which operate in        ???
  different modes to indicate which mode the block or instrument is
  in. The icon text is changed whenever the mode of the block or
  instrument is changed. This currently applies to the source, branch,
  batch, store, and retrieve blocks and the change feed.

  - 3.1 Alpha Rev. 0 E29 ---------------------------------------------

* Added the parameter feed and parameter probe instruments which allow  customadds.kb
  getting and setting the value of a parameter or variable,             Case 6
  respectively. The quantitative parameter to be used by the
  instrument can be created using the create parameter menu choice.
  Alternatively, the parameter or variable can be selected using the
  choose parameter menu choice. The selected parameter or variable can
  be shown by the show parameter menu choice and conversely, the
  instruments can be shown using the show instruments menu choice.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the average probe to calculate the average of the value being   customadds.kb
  sampled. The average probe also keeps track of the minimum and        Case 4
  maximum sample values.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the cumulative sample attribute to the sample probe. When set   customadds.kb
  to true, the sample value attribute maintains the sum of the          Case 5
  samples.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the retrieve copy and add to associations attributes to the     customadds.kb
  retrieve block. When the retrieve copy attribute is set to true, a    Case 7a & 7b
  copy of the retrieved work object is created and sent out while the   Case 8a & 8b
  original remains in the pool. The retrieve copy attribute applies to  Case 9a & 9b
  all retrieve modes except database, as database retrieve mode always
  copies the data from the table and never deletes the record from the
  table. The add to associations attribute is only applicable when the
  retrieve copy attribute is true. It specifies whether or not the
  associations are to copied as well, exactly as in the copy block. 

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the retrieve all attribute to the retrieve block. This has      customadds.kb
  similar but slightly different interpretations depending upon the     Case 7a & 7b
  retrieve mode. In random retrieve mode, it retrieves all of the work  Case 8a & 8b
  objects on the same workspace as the randomly retrieved work object.  Case 9a & 9b
  In association retrieve mode, it retrieves all of the associated
  work objects within the resource pool. In database retrieve mode, it
  retrieves all of the records in the table and uses the data to
  create multiple work objects. Note that the default behavior in the
  database retrieve mode has changed from previous versions, as
  retrieve all is by default set to off and the previous database
  retrieve mode behavior is now equivalent to retrieve all set to on.
  With retrieve all set to off, the database retrieve mode now
  retrieves the next record from the table.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the attribute value lookup mode for the retrieve block. This    customadds.kb
  mode is very similar to the attribute value mode of the branch        Case 7b
  block. The retrieve block now has the attributes retrieve attribute   Case 8b
  operation, retrieve attribute, retrieve attribute value, retrieve     Case 9a & 9b
  range lower, and retrieve range upper. These all operate exactly as
  in the attribute value mode of the branch block. With retrieve all
  set to off, a random work object that meets the attribute value
  criteria is selected. With retrieve all set to on, all of the work
  objects on the workspace that meet the criteria are selected.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the start time and end time attributes to the source block. By  customadds.kb
  default, the first work object is sent from a source block at the     Case 10
  time specified by the duration. By specifying a start time, the user
  can explicitly say when this first work object is sent (independent
  of the duration). The end time specifies the time at which the last
  work object is sent. Note that a work object will always be sent at
  the start time and at the end time. So a source block with a start
  time of 45 minutes, an end time of 60 minutes, and a duration of
  exactly 10 minutes will result in work objects being sent at time 45
  minutes, 55 minutes, and 60 minutes.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the random and unique id modes to the change feed. The          customadds.kb
  original operating mode is now known as the value mode. The random    Case 6
  operating mode generates a random number uniformly distributed        Case 4
  between a minimum value and a maximum value. The unique id operating  Case 5
  mode assigns a unique number, starting with the value specified in    Case 11a, 11b, & 11c
  the initial id attribute.                                             Case 15
                                                                        Case 18
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the output count attribute to the source, task, and copy        customadds.kb
  blocks. This attribute specifies the number of copies of new work     Case 12a & 12b
  objects to make for each output path. The default value is 1, so the  Case 13a & 13b
  standard blocks behave as always. Note that this attribute only
  applies to the source block when in the type operating mode.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the dynamic proportion operating mode to the branch block. In   customadds.kb
  this operating mode, the proportions change based upon the number of  Case 14
  times the work object has looped through the block. The dynamic
  proportions are specified via the edit dynamic proportions... user
  menu choice on the output paths. If the number of times looped
  exceeds the number of dynamic proportions specified, the last
  specified value is used. Other than the fact that the proportions
  change based upon the number of visits, this operating mode is the
  same as the proportion operating mode.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the sum, trigger, and interval operating modes for the batch    customadds.kb
  block, in addition to the number operating mode which was already     Case 15
  provided. As before, the number operating mode releases the batch     Case 16
  when a specified number of work objects exceeds the threshold. The    Case 17
  sum operating mode releases the batch when the sum of values of a     batch-interval.kb
  specified attribute exceeds the threshold. The attribute whose value
  is to be summed is specified in the interval attribute name
  attribute. The trigger operating mode releases the batch when a
  triggering work object is received. The triggering work object is
  specified via the choose trigger input path user menu choice. The
  interval operating mode releases the batch at specific time
  intervals specified via the interval start time, interval end time,
  interval frequency, interval time unit, and interval days
  attributes.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the capability to have the specified duration be a time for     customadds.kb
  each unit, where an attribute of the work object specifies the        Case 18
  number of units it represents. The time per unit attribute name
  attribute of the block duration subtable object specifies the
  attribute of the work object that contains the number of units. The
  duration is then multiplied by the number of units to produce the
  overall duration.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the capability to disable and enable the detail for a task      ???
  block. This is accomplished via the disable detail and enable detail
  user menu choices. When the detail is disabled, the task block
  behaves exactly as if it had no detail defined (except that the icon
  is modified slightly to indicate the a disabled detail exists).

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the snapshot container user menu choice to the container        SnapshotContainer.kb
  object. This lets you view the work objects within a container, as
  you can view the work objects within a path queue using the snapshot
  queue user menu choice.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the capability to allow a user to specify whether the           InstrumentPhase.kb
  instrument attached to a block is evaluated before or after the       Case 1 - 10
  duration. The default is to evaluate after the duration, as was
  always previously the case. The phase attribute of the instrument
  object is used to specify this and can be either start or stop. Also
  added the capability to instrument paths. When the phase attribute
  is set to start, the instrument can be associated with the input
  objects, resources, block, activity, or input paths. When the phase
  attribute is set to stop, the instrument can be associated with the
  output objects, resources, block, activity, or output paths.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

? Fixed some problems with paths losing their values when you used      ???
  junction blocks. To prevent this from happening, I removed the
  delete user menu choice on the junction block class. Instead, users
  should use the delete user menu choice on the connected path.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the operation attribute to the accumulate and increment feed    AccumulateFeedOperation.kb
  instruments. This allows a user to specify alternative arithmetic     Case 1 - 12
  operations. Possible values are "+", "-", "*", "/", and "^". The
  arithmetic operations are always performed on the destination
  attribute value by the source attribute value or increment value.
  So, if the destination attribute has a value of 2, the source
  attribute has a value of 3, and the operation is "-", the new
  destination attribute value will be -1.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the capability to allocate associated resources. The resource   AssociateResourceManager.kb
  manager class has a new association name attribute which, when        Case 1 - 5
  specified, requires that the allocated resources need to be
  associated to the input work object via the named association. The
  user can also specify the number of associated resources to
  allocated using the utilization attribute. If the utilization
  attribute is set to 0 (and the association name is specified), all
  of the associated resources are allocated. If the utilization
  attribute is set to a negative number (and the association name is
  specified), all but that number of the associated resources are
  allocated.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added, removed, and modified user menu choices to try to provide      ???
  some consistency around the use of create and show detail (versus
  create and go to subworkspace). Objects which support a hierarchy
  (task blocks, models, organizers, and resources) now all use the
  convention create detail and show detail. Objects that have a
  specific thing on their subworkspace (scenarios, arrival rate input
  graphs, temporal constraints, annotations, and reports) now all use
  the convention create <object type> (e.g., create report) (where
  appropriate) and show <object type> (e.g., show report). Changes
  from previous versions include show detail is now show constraint
  for temporal constraints, create graph is now create input graph for
  arrival rate input graphs, update graph is now update input graph
  for arrival rate input graphs, create subworkspace is now create
  detail for resources, and all references to go to subworkspace have
  been replaced. Also, the following user menu choices have been
  removed for scenarios (as they are redundant with the control panel
  buttons): jump mode, synch mode, step mode, activate scenario,
  deactivate scenario, start all, reset scenario, resume scenario, and
  pause scenario.

  - 3.1 Alpha Rev. 0 G10 ---------------------------------------------

* Changed the default value for the pop up edit operations menu         ???
  attribute (in the editor parameters system table) to no. This should
  make it more obvious to users that they can use the new G2 5.0
  pending delete feature. We should document the pending delete
  feature and the fact that you can use the Windows standard shortcuts
  for cut, copy, and paste (ctrl-x, ctrl-c, and ctrl-v).

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the attribute redraw-connection to all connections (path,       ???
  instrument connection, and resource manager connection). Setting
  this attribute to false for a connection disables the connection
  redrawing capability for that specific connection. This is
  considered a modeler feature for paths and a customization feature
  for instrument and resource manager connections (the attribute will
  only be visible in developer mode).

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added several new duration distribution procedures. Those added are   Distributions.kb
  the uniform, triangular, erlang, weibull, lognormal, gamma, and beta  Case 1 - 9
  distributions; in addition to the exponential and normal
  distributions previously provided.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the time period attribute to the set instrument dialog of the   ???
  moving average probe. This allows users to set the time period over
  which the moving average is calculated. This was previously only
  available in developer mode.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the connector object to the tools palette. This makes it        ???
  easier to use the feature which allows users to associate connectors
  on different workspaces.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Renamed the top level module from models to rethink. This will        ???
  hopefully reduce the number of issues that we receive because people
  accidentally load the wrong top level module.

  - 3.1 Beta Rev. 0 H19 and Testing Retreat 8/19/98 ------------------

* Added the capability to the source and retrieve blocks to have the    EvaluateQuery.kb
  queries (when in database mode) be evaluated at runtime. The          Case 1 - 4
  delimiters for the expression to be evaluated are the left and right
  brackets (i.e., "[" and "]"). The input object for a retrieve block
  can be accessed via the variable name "InputObject". For example,
  the following is a valid query for the retrieve block: "Select *
  from Orders where OrderID >= [the MinimumOrderID of InputObject] and
  OrderID <= [the MaximumOrderID of InputObject]" (assuming that the
  input work object has the attributes minimumorderid and
  maximumorderid).

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changed the color of the monthly temporal connector from cyan to      ???
  green, so that it would not be confused with the temporal connector
  which is also cyan.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the capability to create type in boxes for the change feed in   ???
  value mode when the value is a non-quantitative value (truth-value,
  symbol, or text). This works exactly like the create type in and
  show type in when the value is a quantitative value. The data type
  of the type in is determined by the data type of value when the type
  in box is created.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changed the behavior of the indicate capability to support two        ???
  different modes; timeout and select (the new default). Timeout mode
  works as in previous versions of ReThink where the indicator is
  removed after some timeout period (10 seconds by default). In select
  mode, the indicator is displayed until the user clicks on the
  indicator. If the indicator is from a breakpoint and the scenario is
  paused, clicking on the indicator (in select mode) also continues
  the scenario. The indicate mode and timeout are set using the
  indicate tab on the set scenario dialog.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the show resources user menu choice to activities and objects.  show-resources-for-work-objects.kb
  On an activity, it shows (using the indicator object) all of the
  resources allocated to that activity. On a work object, it shows all
  of the resources that have been allocated but not deallocated to
  that object.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changed the default behavior of the api procedure bpr-clone-object    CopyItemLists.kb
  to also clone any item lists (and their items) within the object. So  Case 1 - 3
  by default, the copy and retrieve (in retrieve copy mode) blocks and
  junction blocks now copy the item lists and the items within the
  item lists. This default behavior can be altered (in developer mode
  only) by changing the values of the copy item lists and copy item
  list items attributes of these blocks. If users have customized
  procedures that call bpr-clone-object and do not want the item lists
  or items within the item lists copied, then they will need to call
  the alternative form of the procedure (bpr-clone-object(original:
  class bpr-object, CopyItemLists: truth-value, CopyItemListItems:
  truth-value) = (copy: class bpr-object))

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the attribute feed to copy the value of an attribute from one   AttributeFeed.kb
  attribute to another attribute. In the simplest case, both            Case 1 - 5
  attributes are in the same object. In this case, the destination
  class name attribute can be left as none or be set to the same value
  as the apply to class name attribute. In more complex cases, the
  source and destination attributes may actually be in different
  objects. For example, you could put the work time of the activity
  into an attribute of the output work object. This instrument also
  supports an additional phase, called activity. This phase executes
  right before the blocks stop method is executed and allows you to
  set block attributes from the input work object. For example, the
  input work object could carry the desired value of the output count
  attribute of a task block.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Enhanced the object file source mode of the source block to include   ???
  the capability to specify item lists within the file. An item list
  is specified using parenthesis and each item in the list is enclosed
  in parenthesis. For example, the following file would create an item
  list for the attribute line items with objects of class line item in
  it:

  order, line-items, ((line-item, product-name, "G2", product-version,
  "5.1 Rev. 0"), (line-item, product-name, "ReThink", product-version,
  "3.1 Rev. 0"))

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the organize images and make images local user menu choices to  ???
  the organizer object. The organize images user menu choice moves all
  of the image definitions within a model to the detail workspace of
  the organizer. It also removes duplicates in the process, where a
  duplicate is defined as having the same image file as another image
  definition. The make images local user menu choice sets the save
  image data with kb attribute of each image definition on the detail
  workspace to true.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the capability to write rules on the subworkspace of a branch   BranchRules.kb
  block in attribute value mode. The rules could implement more         Case 1
  sophisticated logic (based upon the value of multiple attributes)
  that determine the routing of the work object by setting its branch
  attribute and then using the conventional attribute value mode
  logic. The branch mode in attribute value mode therefore has the new
  create rules and show rules user menu choices. The rules need to be
  of a specific format, which is shown using free text on the branch
  block subworkspace when the create rules user menu choice is
  selected.

  - 3.1 Beta Rev. 0 (J27) --------------------------------------------

* Changed the label of the checkbox on the set report dialog from       ???
  Include All Subworkspaces to Include All Details. This change was
  made to be consistent with the create and show detail conventions
  used for hierarchical objects (e.g. task blocks).

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changed the title of the advanced block and instrument dialogs to     ???
  Set Block Mode and Set Instrument Mode, respectively. This changed
  was made so they could be referred to in a way that differentiated
  them from the set block and set instrument dialogs.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the capability run the Excel spreadsheet reports on a remote    ???
  system. If the create report menu choice is selected from a remote
  Telewindows session, the Excel spreadsheet report is spawned on the
  remote system. Also added the program attribute to the Excel tab
  page of the set summary report dialog. Users must also change the
  G2Location property of the ActiveXLink control in the Excel
  spreadsheet to point to the server machine and port (it is
  localhost:1111 by default).

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed a problem where multiple sub-dialogs (e.g. set duration) would  ???
  be displayed if the user clicked on the initiating control (e.g. the
  other durations radio button) multiple times. Now only one instance
  of a sub-dialog can be displayed at once (even for different
  objects). Selecting the initiating control again asks the user if
  they want to save the changes before starting a new edit session.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Modified the code for displaying the set duration dialog to fix some  ???
  problems with it not being updated properly. The Parameter and Graph
  tab pages are now initially disabled until the desired duration is
  selected.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed some problems with the batch block in trigger mode. If users    TriggerBatch.kb
  want the trigger object to be sent out by the batch block, they need  Case 1 - 7
  to use the choose trigger output path menu choice to select the
  desired output path.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changed all of the references to object definitions in procedures to  ???
  class definition. All existing object definitions were left as such,
  but we want to encourage users to start using class definitions from
  now on. Therefore, the object definition on the tools palette was
  changed to a class definition (and the help ID therefore has
  changed). Other examples of where users encounter this include now
  creating a class definition when running a model encounters a new
  path type and dropping an icon tool on a block, instrument, or
  resource now creates a class definition.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added code to change the label of resource managers when the label    ???
  of the related resource is changed. Note that this can only work
  when a scenario is activated.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the clear breaks and clear indicators buttons to the scenario   ???
  control panel. The clear breaks button sets the break point
  attribute for all blocks in the model to false. The clear indicators
  button deletes all of the indicator objects in the model.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

? Added back the delete menu choice for junction blocks, with all of    ???
  the code necessary to preserve path attributes.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

? Updated the Aero model to include two block summary reports and a     ???
  customized version of the ReThink Summary Reports.xls spreadsheet
  called Aero Summary Reports.xls. This demonstrates the capability to
  perform additional calculations using the spreadsheet and then chart
  the results.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Pre-configured the online help to initially install just the ReThink  ???
  User's Guide and Quick Reference books.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

? Updated the scenario start time to be January 1, 1999 by default,     ???
  rather than 1998. Also updated the copyright to include 1999 on the
  About ReThink... workspace.

  - 3.1 Beta Rev. 0 (A05) --------------------------------------------

* Removed the time unit attribute of the batch block in interval mode.  batch-interval.kb
  The start time, end time, and frequency attributes are all now        test-models.kb
  explicit intervals. Note that this change may cause problems for
  beta users, as these attributes are no longer multiplied by the time
  unit attribute.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Moved the output count attribute of the source block to the set       ???
  block mode dialog, since it is specific to the source mode of type.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added the capability to associate all of the work objects waiting at  test-models.kb
  an associate block. This is the associate block equivalent of the
  reconcile all capability of the reconcile block. The set block
  dialog now has an associate all attribute.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the Getting Started with ReThink book to the online document-   ???
  ation, added the necessary code for the help-ids, and made it one of
  the default installed books.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changed all of the color edit boxes to combo boxes which list the     ???
  available colors. This change is reflected on the animation tab of
  the set block, set instrument, set resource, set path, and set
  surrogate dialogs, as well as the chart tab of the set chart dialog.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added the distribution images to the graph tab of the set duration    ???
  dialogs. The images change as different duration distributions are
  selected on the duration tab.
