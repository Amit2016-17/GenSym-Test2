GEDP Modification Log


Date		Developer

1/6/03		msn

	1.  Added new alogrithm for the median-input block

	2.  Fixed bug in inverse block evaluator where the inverse was only done
	    if the value was greater than zero otherwise the input was just passed
	    on.

	3.  Fixed gain block configuration dialog to point to the gedp-gain instead
	    of the old _gedp-gain.

	NOTE: Evaluating entry points that feed peer input blocks results in a block 
	      error on the first entry point that has no value that gedp finds 
	      connected to the peer input block being evaluated.

	4.  Fixed data delay block configuration dialog to point to gedp-delay
	    instead of the old _gedp-delay.

	5.  Fixed override-value block evaluator.  It was displaying the structure
	    instead of the current-value of the structure to the override dialog
	    and then passing it on.


2/11/03		msn

	1.  Moved gedp dialogs (64) to non-proprietary workspace.

	2.  Added gedp-signal-generator as a direct superior class of 
	    gedp-sine-wave-block, gedp-real-time-clock & gedp-white-noise-block.
	
	3.  Added new attributes gedp-reset-time (float) and gedp-reset-phase, 
	    a truth-value determining whether the phase-angle is reset when 
	    the block is.

	4.  Reworked the evaluator, _gedp-evaluate-block, for the
	    gedp-sine-wave-block.

	5.  Added an action to the OK/Apply buttons of the config dialog of the 
	    standard-deviation & discrete-rate-of-change blocks to initialize them 
	    after the configuration is complete.


2/14/03		msn

	Conflict on reload (after updating from CVS changes made on 2/13)
            -- gedp-diagram & gedp-diagram in gedpq -- strange inheritance from 
            grtl-scheme-from-gedp & grtl-scheme-from-gedpq, classes which did not 
            exist.  Changed superior to grtl-scheme and merged.

	1. Re-added the action to the OK/Apply buttons of the
            dialog of the standard-deviation & discrete-ra
            of-change blocks to initialize them after the
            configuration is complete.  This change appare
            did not make it into the last commit -- either
            not save it when I thought I did or CVS someho
            to save it correctly.
	2. Deleted the class & hierarchy for gedp-item-or-valu
            a. Removed code from gedp-generic-value-entry-
               block::_gedp-reset-block to remove referenc
               was not used.
            b. Deleted method gedp-bias-block::_gedp-check
               connection which was not used.
            c. Deleted the procedure test-this & associate
	3. Created an new mixin class gedp-block-with-attribut
            name that has the attribute gedp-attribute-val
            Made this the a superior class in 37 class def
            and removed that attribute from those definiti
	4. Added an initialization method for the classes gedp
            history-value-block, gedp-standard-deviation-2
            gedp-discrete-rate-of-change-2-block.  It chec
            preceding float-variable-block (required for t
            blocks) and if the spec is - do not keep histo
            sets the history-keeping-spec to a time interv
            appropriate for the time setting on the block.


3/20/03		msn

	Replaced the call to cdg-send-event with a call to grtl-dispatch-event 
	in 2 procedures:  gedp-post-cdg-event-block::_gedp-evaluate-block & 
	gedp-smo-post-cdg-event-block::_gedp-evaluate-block.


3/24/03		msn

	changed the way we detect the presence of CDG 4.0 in the evaluators
	for the 2 blocks that post cdg events;  gedp-post-cdg-event-block &
  	gedp-smo-post-cdg-event-block.  They now look for the object named
  	by the symbol _cdg-symcure.  If it is present then we are using V4.0
  	otherwise we are in a pre-4.0 version.  This is used for calling the
  	compatibility code for pre-4.0 software.


5/12/03		msn

	1. Added data inhibit block & dialog.
	2. Added generic action block (function or procedure) & dialog.
	3. Added message-type attribute to post message blocks (2) &
	   emended dialog.
	4. Added dialog for gedp-diagram-template.
	5. Added dialog fields for gedp-source-datapoint-key &
	   gedp-evaluate-upon-source-datapoint-change.
	6. Added pattern replacement for raw event and post message blocks (4).


5/13/03		msn

	1. Added attribute gedp-message-type to gedp-post-message-block & 
  	   gedp-io-post-message-block.
	2. Added error messages to gedp-text-resources -- property dialog errors
  	   for message type edits.
	3. Changed category attribute from symbol to text in evaluators for:
		gedp-post-message-block
		gedp-io-post-message-block
		gedp-post-raw-event-block
		gedp-io-post-raw-event-block
	4. Added grtl-show-properties method for gedp-diagram & gedp-block.
	5. Added new properties dialog for gedp-template-diagram.
	6. Enhanced entry point properties dialogs (6).  Added fields for
  	   source-datapoint-key & evaluate-on-source-datapoint-change.
	7. Added new generic-action-block which allows the user to execute a
  	   function or procedure in a diagram.  Function or procedure takes
  	   a gedp-block and a value as arguments and returns a value (the procedure
  	   can actually return a item or a value).
	8. Added new inhibit block which passes or does not pass an item-or-value
  	   based on the state of a truth-value operated inhibitor.
	9. Added attribute substitution to 4 evaluators:
		gedp-post-message-block
		gedp-io-post-message-block
		gedp-post-raw-event-block
		gedp-io-post-raw-event-block
	10. For gedp-post-cdg-event-block & gedp-io-post-cdg-event-block:
  	    a. Changed 3 attribute names:  
		gedp-send-cdg-true-states to gedp-send-cdg-true-events
		gedp-send-cdg-suspect-states to gedp-send-cdg-suspect-events
		gedp-send-cdg-false-states to gedp-send-cdg-false-events
  	    b. Added the 3 above attributes to the properties dialog for each
		block.


5/15/03		msn

	1. Added new block gedp-switch-block & properties dialog.
	   The properties dialog required several new procedures
	   and a temporary storage object.
	2. Added a properties dialog for gedp-inhibit-block.
	3. Fixed up some help texts on the subworkspaces of the
	   uil-help-buttons which I had cloned or whose dialogs
	   I had cloned.
	4. Added switch block to data control palette.


5/16/03		msn

	1. Restricted item starting with underscore on switch block.
	2. Added small borders around the inputs (1, 2 & 3) on the
	   switch block dialog.
	3. Added 2 rules to the gedp-block workspace to handle block
	   connections & disconnections.
	4. Made Tasha's label changes of the following dialogs:
		Dialog template:  Key -> Name
		Entry Points: Source Datapoint Key --> S... D... Name
		Fetch Named Object:  Name or Key --> Name


5/19/03		msn

	1. Added check for block existance within the repeat loops on 
	   the 3 signal generators.


5/22/03		msn

	1. Changed desactivate to deactivate on gedp-block user menu choice.
  	2. Changed palette labels according to Natasha's suggestions.
  	3. Replaced "gevm" with "gedp" in the following misnamed objects and 
    	   all references:
		gevm-block-evaluation-count
		gevm-block-evaluation-rate
		gevm-block-evaluation-rate-start-time
	4. Finished switch block dialog.
  	5. Finished diagram dialog (prototype - needs review).


5/23/03		msn
	1. Removed the top tier of stuff (help button, block, output text &
    	   top thin separator) from all block property dialogs.
	2. Changed the toggle buttons on all block dialogs so that there is
    	   only one label for the button forming a statement and the state of
    	   the button declaring whether that statement is true of false.  This
    	   was done to eliminate the confusion of dual labels and toggle states.
