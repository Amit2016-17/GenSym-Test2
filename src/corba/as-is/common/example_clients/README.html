<H1>README File for G2-CORBALink Examples</H1>
<P>&nbsp; </P>
<H3>INTRODUCTION:</H3>
<P>This file contains instructions for using the examples that are shipped with G2-CORBALink.&nbsp; These examples are designed to show how to use G2-CORBALink to distribute objects between G2’s systems as well as between G2 and other languages such as Java or C++.&nbsp; The two included KB files are: </P>
<P>Feature.kb: This file shows some of the features available to the developer.&nbsp;&nbsp; It includes sample C++ and Java clients and servers. </P>
<P>Publish.kb:&nbsp; This shows a example of a publish/subscribe system using CORBA. </P>
<P>To use the examples: </P>
<P>1) Start the ORB with the following command line: &quot;g2-corba 20000 1594&quot; <BR>
2) Start G2 and load the file &quot;feature.kb&quot; or &quot;publish.kb&quot;. <BR>
3) Start G2. <BR>
4) Follow the instructions in the demo. </P>
<P><HR></P>
<H3>C++ EXAMPLE:</H3>
<P>The C++ program called &quot;client&quot; is included in the cpp directory. It is designed to work with the &quot;Simple CORBA Operations&quot; example in feature.kb.&nbsp; To use this example, simply load and start the feature.kb example kb and run &quot;client&quot;.&nbsp; This will act as a CORBA client and make method calls on a G2 object.&nbsp; The source code may be found in the file &quot;client.cpp&quot;. </P>
<P><HR></P>
<H3>JAVA EXAMPLES:</H3>
<P>There are several Java examples included in the java directory.&nbsp; These examples require a Java 1.1 Virtual Machine to be installed.&nbsp; The Java Development Kit 1.1 is available for download from www.javasoft.com.&nbsp; All needed class files are included.&nbsp; The user does not need to set the CLASSPATH environment variable. </P>
<P>The source code for these examples is included.&nbsp; The javaIDL package from javasoft was used to build these examples.&nbsp; JavaIDL is available from www.javasoft.com and includes a IDL compiler for Java and a IIOP compatible ORB. </P>
<P>The included examples are: </P>

<UL>
<LI>gridClient:&nbsp; This is a Java version of the C++ client.&nbsp; It will call methods and access attributes of a G2 object.&nbsp; This runs with the &quot;Simple CORBA Operations&quot; example of feature.kb.&nbsp; To start the Java client, use the command line &quot;java gridClient&quot;.&nbsp; The source code may be found in the file gridClient.java. </LI>
<LI>gridServer:&nbsp; This is a Java server.&nbsp; It allows G2 to call methods in the Java server.&nbsp; To use this example, first load and start the feature.kb.&nbsp; Then use the command line &quot;java gridServer&quot;.&nbsp; A proxy object (looks like a cube) will appear on the &quot;Simple CORBA Operations&quot; example workspace.&nbsp; This object has menu choices that access the Java server.&nbsp; The source code may be found in the file gridServer.java </LI>
<LI>mappingServer:&nbsp; This is a Java server that shows how IDL types are mapped into Java.&nbsp; This runs with the &quot;Mapping of IDL Types&quot; example of feature.kb.&nbsp; First load and start feature.kb, then run &quot;java mappingServer&quot;.&nbsp; The buttons on the G2 workspace will then call the Java methods.&nbsp; The source code may be found in mappingServer.java </LI>
<LI>mappingClient:&nbsp; This is a Java client that calls methods in G2 and shows the mapping of the IDL types.&nbsp; First load and start feature.kb, then run &quot;java mappingClient&quot;.&nbsp; Messages will display on the message board to show the data that is sent to G2.&nbsp; The source code may be found in mappingClient.java </LI>
<LI>consumer:&nbsp; This is a Java event consumer for the publish.kb.&nbsp; Load and start publish.kb, then run &quot;java consumer&quot;.&nbsp; The Java program will display events published by G2. </LI></UL>
