To process a yacc input file (.y), enter the following:

	yacc -l -d filename.y

To do the same with Bison: 

	bison -l -d filename.y


For the corba_bridge project, take the yacc output files: y.tab.c and y.tab.h and rename 
them to ytab.c and ytab.h:

	mv y.tab.c ytab.c
	mv y.tab.h ytab.h


Note: For the corba project, yacc was run on DUBLIN (OSF/1, v2.0). Other systems (PELE, which
      is at Solaris 2.5 as of this writing) will generate slightly different y.tab files, but 
      they should work just as well. 
Note: the Bison parser-generator was used in the corba project as a check on what yacc
      would produce, since it had some different (better, sometimes) error messages.
      Bison wasn't used for the corba bridge however, as GNU licensing forbids the use of the 
      output in commercial products.

      Bison was run on syseng3 (HP-UX 10.x.x)
