Instructions on building GDA and NOL.

This directory contains the file buildgdanol.  This is a script
which can be run on a Sun Solaris.  It is written in Unix
script, but does not run on all unix platforms.

The script assumes that you have previously created a sandbox,
and that this sandbox is coded in a script local variable.
In that sandbox you should checkout the module gdanol.  As 
part of the build script, the sandbox is brought up to date.

The script launches a G2 to run through a build checklist.
This checklist is contained (and automated) in the file
top.kb (found in the common directory).  The checklist assumes
that the included KBs are completely ready for the build.  If 
you are making the first pass at a build, you probably want
to load top.kb separately.  Specific things to check:
  - Are the to dos completed.
  - Are the items with notes cleaned up.
  - Are the build numbers, version numbers and build dates 
    (in the module top) up to date.

After the automated build sequence has run, the G2 will reset
and several final steps must be completed by hand.  
  1. The KBs are archived to a source location
  2. Package preparation mode is entered
  3. The KBs are text stripped
  4. The KBs are made proprietary
  5. The KBs are saved to a distribution location
After these manual steps are completed, shut down the G2.
At this point the build script will resume and begin 
operating on the newly created distribution directories.

The script also checks back into CVS the "non-destructive"
modifications to the source.  The files are also locked,
pending tagging of the sources by the person who made the 
build.  Generally it is appropriate to tag the sources only
after the decision has been made to ship the product as
built.

The distribution files are saved to to directories.  One is
in /home/apps/kits/<vernum>/distribution and one in 
/home/gda/kits/<vernum>/distribution (or neuron for 
NOL).  The /home/apps are contains files for both GDA and
NOL, but not certain files such as the demos.  The /home/gda
area contains the product files, exactly as they will ship.
It is from the /home/gda area that you actually promote 
the files to the iship area.
