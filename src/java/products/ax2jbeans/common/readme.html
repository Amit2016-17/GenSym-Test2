Gensym <b>BeanXporter</b> automatically converts an ActiveX control to a JavaBean component by wrapping the control to meet
JavaBean standards. Once converted, the new Java Bean is ready for use in your Windows-based Java applications as you
would any other Bean. Since the new Java Bean bridges to the original ActiveX control, you get the assurance that you
are working with the original functionality of the ActiveX control. 
<P>
<b>BeanXporter</b> also lets you use Microsoft Office documents as Java Beans. With <b>BeanXporter</b> your Windows-based Java
projects can take advantage of ActiveX controls and Office documents such as those for spreadsheets, charts, calendars,
word processors, reports, specialized graphics, and many more.

<p>
</p>
If you have not done so already - download the software by visiting the <b>BeanXporter</b>
home page at <a href="http://www.gensym.com/java"> "http://www.gensym.com/java"</a>

<ul> 
<li> Check you have installed Sun's Java Development Kit 
(JDK) 1.1.6 or greater, available from the
 <A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/">JDK
Download Page.</A>
<li> Check that the environment variable <b>JAVA_HOME</b> refers to the installation
 of the JDK. 
<li> Run the self extracting executable which will guide you through installing the
  software and documentation.
</ul>

<h3> Setting Environment Variables </h3>

BeanXporter requires environment variables that specify the locations of your
Java Development Kit (JDK) and BeanXporter installations.  The following table
describes the environment variables that must be created or appended to:

<p>
<TABLE BORDER COLS=2 WIDTH="100%">

<TR>
<TD> 
<b>Variable</b>
</TD>

<TD>
<b>Description</b>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD> 
<b>JAVA_HOME</b>
</TD>

<TD>
Specifies the absolute path to your installation of the JDK.  
The beanxporter.bat file uses the JAVA_HOME variable to locate
a Java interpreter to launch BeanXporter.
</TD>
</TR>


<TR>
<TD> 
<b>BEANXPORTER_HOME</b>
</TD>

<TD>
Specifies the absolute path of the BeanXporter installation.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD> 
<b>PATH</b>
</TD>

<TD>
Specifies the absolute path to the directory containing the
beanXporter.bat file and the JavaContainer.dll library, so that 
the Java interpreter can locate the library at runtime.
<br>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD> 
<b>CLASSPATH</b>
</TD>

<TD>
Specifies the absolute path to directories used by BeanXporter,
which enables the Java interpreter to:
<ul>
<li> Load the Java classes required by BeanXporter. These classes 
are located in the ax2jbeans.jar file.
<li> Load classes that were emitted by BeanXporter.
</ul>
</TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>

<h4> Setting Environment Variables on Windows NT</h4>

On Windows NT, all the environment variables are automatically set
during installation, except for the JAVA_HOME variable.  Setting the
JAVA_HOME variable is described in this section.  If you want, you can
modify all the environment variables using the Control Panel.
<p>
The following table shows examples of the environment variables defined
for Windows NT:

</TD>
</TR>


</TABLE>
<p>
<b>To set the JAVA_HOME variable on Windows NT:</b>

<ol>
<li> Open the System icon in the Control Panel.
<li> Click the Environment tab.
<li> Create the JAVA_HOME variable, or, if one exists, check to
see that it is correct.
<li> Set the value of the JAVA_HOME variable, for example:<br>
	C:\JDK-1.1.6
</ol>

<h4>Setting Environment Variables on Windows 95/98</h4>

On Windows 95, you must edit the autoexec.bat file to set
the environment variables.
<p>
<b>To set environment variables on Windows 95/98</b>
<ol>
<li> Open a text editor, such as NotePad or WordPad;
<li> Open the autoexec.bat file on drive C;
<li> Set the value of the JAVA_HOME variable, for example:<br>
	 SET JAVA_HOME=C:\JDK-1.1.6
<li> Set the value of the BEANXPORTER_HOME variable, for example:<br>
	 SET BEANXPORTER_HOME=C:\GENSYM\BX-10R2
<li> Modify the value of the PATH variable, for
	example<br>
	SET PATH=C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND;C:\JDK-1.1.6\BIN;<br>
	%BEANXPORTER_HOME%\BIN
<li> Modify the value of the CLASSPATH variable, for example:<br>
	SET CLASSPATH=.;C:\JDK-1.1.6\lib\classes.zip;%BEANXPORTER_HOME%\classes;<br>
	%BEANXPORTER_HOME%\classes\ax2jbeans.jar
<li> After completing all the edits to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file change the environment variables by executing the following in a DOS shell:<br> 
	C:> autoexec.bat 
</ol>

Note - Beta users on Windows 95/98 who are upgrading to 1.0 Rev 2,
only need to edit the BEANXPORTER_HOME environment variable.

<h2 align="center"><A name = "configuration"> Configuration</a> </h2>
<p>
</p>

Configuration of <b>BeanXporter</b> is controlled by the .com.gensym.properties
file.  During installation this file will be added to the directory specified
by the <b>HOME</b> environment variable.  If a <b>HOME</b> environment variable
is not defined the properties file is added to the classes directory of the
BeanXporter install.

The .com.gensym.properties file defines the following properties:

<ul>
<li>com.gensym.emitdir  - the default root location where BeanXporter will emit files
<li>com.gensym.emitpackage	- the default root package into which BeanXporter will emit classes	
</ul>

See the <a href="docs/guides/titlepag.htm"> Users Guide</a> for a more detailed 
discussion of these properties.

<h4>Licensing</h4>

Support for licensed ActiveX components has been added to BeanXporter 
1.0r2.  See the <a href="docs/guides/titlepag.htm"> Users Guide</a> 
for more information.


<h4>Bug fixes</h4>

See the on-line list of <a href="http://www.gensym.com/java/known.html"> known
problems</a> for information on which bugs have been fixed since Beta 0.
<p>

<U>BeanXporter 1.0 Rev 2 also includes the following changes that were made in
Rev 1, Rev 0, Beta 1 and Beta 2:</U>

<h4>Runtime Error reporting</h4>

BeanXporter 1.0 Rev 1 includes better error reporting.  Failures to 
dispatch ActiveX methods are now propagated to Java.  If the "emit 
exceptions" option is chosen in the BeanXporter wizard these failures
will result in an ActiveXDispatchException being thrown at runtime.  
The ActiveXDispatchException will contain the error code of the failure
and additional information when provided by the ActiveX component. If
the "emit exceptions" option is not chosen in the BeanXporter wizard
the error will appear in a trace that can be retrieved by using the
ActiveTraceTool class.

<h4>BeanInfo classes</h4>

BeanXporter 1.0 Rev 1 will create one BeanInfo class for every Java Bean
that is emitted. The BeanInfo class simplifies the method, property and
event interfaces presented to a Beans editing tool. 

<h4>Events</h4>

If an ActiveX component has an event source interface an analogous Java Listener
interface and event class is emitted by BeanXporter.  1.0 Rev 1 makes it possible
to add listeners to events taking place in ActiveX components.  See the
InternetExplorer example in classes\com\gensym\demos\inetbrowser for an
example use of the Events facility.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><a name="faq">Frequently Asked Questions </a></H2>

<H4>Q. How does BeanXporter work?</H4>
<P>
A. For developers, BeanXporter provides a conversion tool that first reads the type library associated with the ActiveX
control, and then emits the appropriate Java code needed to export the control for use as a JavaBean component with all the
original properties, methods, and events. The Java code is automatically compiled into Java bytecode and added to Java
Archive Files (.JAR). The end result is that the original ActiveX control is wrapped with the appropriate Java code. 

For runtime use, BeanXporter provides a lightweight Dynamic Linked Library (DLL) and a small set of Java classes that
enable runtime communication between Java and ActiveX controls.

<H4>Q. What platforms does BeanXporter support?</H4>
<P>
A. BeanXporter's developer conversion tool and runtime files run on Intel-based Microsoft Windows 95 and NT platforms. At
this time, Gensym does not plan to support platforms other than those based on Microsoft Windows.

<H4>Q. Does BeanXporter convert ALL ActiveX controls to JavaBean components?</H4>
<P>
A. There are thousands of commercially available ActiveX controls. The vast majority of these controls will be convertible with
the BeanXporter. Gensym has tested the BeanXporter with the most popular ActiveX controls and OLE documents. 

<H4>Q. Is BeanXporter available for resale by other software vendors?</H4>
<P>
A. Yes. Software vendors interested in repackaging and reselling BeanXporter as part of their product offerings should
contact Gensym. Please either email your inquiry to beanxporter@gensym.com or contact the BeanXporter Product
Marketing Manager at (617) 547-2500 x225.
