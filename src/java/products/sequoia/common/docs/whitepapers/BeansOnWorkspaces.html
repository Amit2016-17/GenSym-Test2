<h3>
<a NAME="audience"></a>0.0 Audience</h3>
This document is intended for a technical audience. It assumes a deep knowledge
of G2, Java, JavaBeans, Java Serialization, AWT, JavaLink/G2-Gateway, and
the architecture of Telewindows2 components. These subjects are documented
throughly in other publications. A complete understanding of these topics
is ncessary to follow the material presented here.
<h3>
<a NAME="notation"></a>0.1 Notation</h3>
G2 keywords such as classes and modules are denoted using a sans-serif
font, e.g. <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>G2-JAVA-BEAN</font>.
</font>Java
keywords and classes are denoted using a fixed width font such as <tt>java.awt.Component</tt>.
Terms with special meaning that are defined later in the document are italicized,
such as <i>stub</i>.
<h3>
<a NAME="introduction"></a>1.0 Introduction</h3>
The <tt>WorkspaceView</tt> component in the Telewindows2Toolkit (abbreviated
as T2T) can be used to display <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>kb-workspace</font></font>s
in a T2 client. WorkspaceViews have the contract of being able to represent
data compatibly with G2 and classic Telewindows. <tt>WorkspaceView</tt>
is a lightweight AWT Container. It typically contains <tt>Component</tt>s
that visually represent the G2 items resident on the workspace. The choice
of <tt>Component</tt> to represent a particular item is dependent upon
its representation-type. Using this criterion, all G2 system-defined classes
can be classified into iconic-objects, text-boxes, trend-charts, charts,
connections, buttons, etc. User-defined sub-classes inherit the representation-type
of their parent.
<p>However, the WorkspaceView is capable of hosting arbitrary native widgets
and controls. Any Java bean (as defined by the <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/beans">Java
Bean Specification</a>) that is a subclass of <tt>java.awt.Component</tt>
can be hosted by a WorkspaceView. This facility allows the UI developer
to integrate built-in and 3rd-party controls into their G2 application.
For example, developers can hook up a variety of charts to display real-time
information from G2 or use sophisticated widgets to manipulate G2 data.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="overview"></a>2.0 Overview</h3>
In order to provide this feature, T2T leverages functionality provided
by <i>JavaLink</i>. In addition todefining a mapping between G2 types and
classes and Java types and classes, JavaLink also defines the reverse mapping
from Java to G2. Any Java class that is imported in G2 is represented by
a G2 class that bears the fully qualified name of the Java class, with
a small degree of mangling. For example, the class
<tt>java.awt.TextField</tt>
is imported as the G2 class
<font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>JAVA.AWT.TEXT-FIELD</font></font>.
The methods of the Java class are available as G2 methods on the generated
G2 class, which subclasses <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>JGI-JAVA-PROXY</font></font>.
The classes and types of all methods are also imported. When an instance
of the Java class is passed to G2 (via a JavaLink RPC call argument or
a return value), an instance of the corresponding G2 class is created and
substituted for every occurrence of the original instance in the RPC call.
This G2 object is referred to as a <i>stub</i> that is a placeholder for
the Java object in G2. It can be transparently used in place of the Java
object for all operations. These stubs are, however, transient and have
utility and meaning only as long as the Virtual Machine in which the Java
object lives is running.
<p>If the KB contains the module <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>t2beans</font></font>
(packaged with Telewindows2Toolkit), users can optionally generate a <i>G2
bean</i> class for any Java class. This bean class extends <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>G2-JAVA-BEAN</font></font>,
a new system-class introduced for ths purpose. The name follows the protocol
of appending "-BEAN" to the name of the stub class. For example the G2
bean class corresponding to the java class <tt>java.awt.TextField</tt>
would be <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>JAVA.AWT.TEXT-FIELD-BEAN</font></font>.
<u>The
bean class reflects all the methods available on the stub</u>. Such
<font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>G2-JAVA-BEAN</font></font>s
can be instantiated and placed on kb-workspaces in G2. They can be made
permanent and saved in the KB. Their appearance is dependent on where the
workspace is viewed. In G2 and classic Telewindows, they inherit the iconic
appearance of <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>G2-JAVA-BEAN</font></font>.
However, when the workspace is viewed in a WorkspaceView within a T2T client,
an instance of the Java class is instantiated and placed in the View.

<h3>
<a NAME="mechanics-and-storage"></a>4.0 Mechanics and Storage</h3>
It is not immediately apparent from the previous section what the G2 bean
class offers over the stub class generated by Javalink, given that they
expose the exact same API. The differences are detailed below:
<ul>
<li>
The stub is the handle to a Java object in G2. There is a one-to-one correspondence
between the two. The bean class, on the other hand, is a repository of
information on how to instantate the Java bean. Besides the obvious information
of which Java class to instantiate (each <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>G2-JAVA-BEAN</font></font>
subclass corresponds to a different Java class) and the dimensions (from
the extent of the bean on the workspace), the bean can be used to hold
more data for initialization. In particular, it provides a stream for serializing
any Java object, which then serves as a template for all subsequent instances.
The storage for this stream is provided by a <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>MEDIA-BIN</font></font>
object. This embedded media-bin is not directly accessible. However, access
to saving and retrieving the data is provided in the Java interface <tt><a href="../../../../JavaLink/docs/api/com.gensym.classes.G2JavaBean.html">com.gensym.classes.G2JavaBean</a></tt>.
Since a workspace can be viewed on many T2T clients at the same time (or
for that matter, in many views on the same client), there is a many-to-one
relationship between the Java instances and the G2 bean they represent.</li>

<li>
The bean provides broadcast behavior over all the Java objects representing
a particular bean. In particular all void methods (the ones that do not
return any value) called on the G2 bean with result in the method being
called on all the corresponding Java beans with the same arguments. <u>At
this time, the semantics of method calls with return values is not defined.</u>
If in any future release of Telewindows2Toolkit, the semantics of such
calls is decided, the details will be documented in this specification.</li>

<li>
The bean provides a locus for adding listeners to the Java beans. Consider
the <tt>addTextListener</tt> method on the java class <tt>java.awt.TextField</tt>.
This causes the generation of <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1">add-text-listener
</font>methods
on the <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>JAVA.AWT.TEXT-FIELD</font></font>
stub class and the <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>JAVA.AWT.TEXT-FIELD-BEAN</font></font>
bean class. If the application is interested in receiving text events from
the Java instances, it can add a listener to the G2 bean by calling add-text-istener
on it at any time (before or after the Java beans have been instantiated).
This typically involves defining a subclass of <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>JAVA.AWT.EVENT.TEXT-LISTENER</font></font>
in the KB and writing the code to be executed in the <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>text-value-changed</font></font>
method of the subclass. This listener list is permanent and the hookup
is saved with the KB.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="operation"></a>5.0 Operation</h3>
Consider a T2T client logging in to a G2 application over a <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>UI-CLIENT-SESSION</font></font>
and downloading a kb-workspace containing a <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>G2-JAVA-BEAN</font></font>
(say a <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>JAVA.AWT.TEXT-FIELD-BEAN</font></font>).
When this kb-workspace is added to a <tt>WorkspaceView</tt>, a <tt>java.awt.TextField</tt>
is created. The instantiation can happen in one of two ways: if there is
a saved instance within the G2 bean, it is retrieved using the <tt><a href="../../../../JavaLink/docs/api/com.gensym.classes.G2JavaBean.html#retrieveObject">retrieveObject</a></tt>
method of <a href="../../../../JavaLink/docs/api/com.gensym.classes.G2JavaBean.html">G2JavaBean</a>.
The new instance is created by deserialization. If no saved data is available,
the no-argument constructor of the Java class corresponding to the G2 bean
is called. If the Java class is not found, a default representation is
used to indicate the presence of the item on the workspace. The Java bean
is added to the view at the location occupied by the G2 bean. Each Java
bean is then registered with the KB so that subsequent operations can find
it. There is a facility for a public callback through the <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>BEAN-LISTENER</font></font>
interface. Then, all listeners that were added to the bean by the application
are hooked up to the stub so that events generated by the Java bean can
be transmitted to the listeners. At this point, the Java bean and G2 bean
are set up for two way communication of methods (from G2 -> Java) and events
(from Java -> G2). When the workspace is removed from the view, the Java
bean is deregistered with the KB so that it can be properly disposed off
and garbage collected. This causes the removal of all KB listeners from
the Java bean.

<h4>
<a NAME="bean-listener-api"></a>6.2 The BEAN-LISTENER interface</h4>
<font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>G2-JAVA-BEAN</font></font>
defines two methods, <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>add-g2-bean-listener</font></font>
and <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>remove-g2-bean-listener</font></font>.
These take a single argument which is of the class <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>G2-BEAN-LISTENER</font></font>.
This class provides a hook to listen for stubs being registered and deregistered
from the G2 bean. There are two methods in this interface class: <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>bean-stub-created</font></font>,
which is called when any Java bean is registered with the G2 bean and <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>bean-stub-disposed</font></font>,
which is called when any Java bean is deregistered. The single argument
to these methods is of the class <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>G2-BEAN-EVENT</font></font>.
There are two methods in the event class: <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>get-source</font></font>,
which returns the <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>G2-JAVA-BEAN</font></font>
for which the stub has been created or disposed, and <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 1"><font size=-1>get-stub</font></font>,
which returns the relevant stub. These classes and methods are summarized
below.

<h3>
<a NAME="interaction"></a>7.0 Interacting with Beans</h3>
For the most part, the Java beans on <tt>WorkspaceView</tt> are good citizens
within the <tt>Container</tt>. They behave similarly to the other <tt>WorkspaceElements</tt>
on the view. All the <tt>Components</tt> contained within a <tt>WorkspaceView</tt>
without beans are <i>lightweight</i>, in that they share a common resource
on the native windowing system and are rendered completely in Java. However,
when the WorkspaceView hosts beans that are <i>heavyweight</i>, unexpected
consequences follow. These heavyweight Components have their own opaque,
native window. These windows float over all the other lightweight <tt>Components</tt>
in the application and do not observe expected layering constraints. Other
anomalies include increased flickering while scrolling and failure to indicate
WorkspaceElement state (such as when the element is "cut").
<p>There are a couple of new entries in the popup menu for these beans.
<li>
Edit Bean...</li>

<ul>
<li>
This displays a Property sheet that allows the user to edit the public
fields of the bean. It can be used to customize the appearance from the
public properties of the bean (e.g. Colors, Fonts, State).</li>
</ul>

<li>
Save Bean...</li>

<ul>
<li>
If the bean is customized (using the Property Sheet) or by other means,
the state of the bean can be serialized into the G2 bean with this menu
choice.&nbsp;<b> </b>All subsequent views will create beans using this
data. <b>Note: This action will fail on objects which fail to serialize
properly. This action must be performed before G2 listeners are added to
the bean. G2 listeners are not serializable and interfere with the saving
of the bean.</b></li>
</ul>
Some beans handle all mouse events within the component, which might result
in it being impossible to "grab" them or post the context-menu on them.
In order to allow these operations on such beans, a new property <tt>com.gensym.wksp.beans.borderwidth</tt>
is used. If it is missing, a value of <tt>0</tt> is used. The value of
this property is the number of pixels of padding around the bean that can
be used to do these operations. This border area is usually transparent.
The color can be specified by using the property <tt>com.gensym.wksp.beans.bordercolor</tt>
as a String containing hexadecimal representation of the color (e.g. "0xFF00FF").
<p>In addition, when connected to a G2 KB with T2BEANS loaded, there is
an extra menu choice on the popup menu for the WorkspaceView - "New Bean..."
Choosing it brings up a palette of the beans currently imported into G2.
This palette can be used to drop G2 beans off on workspaces. It also allows
the user to import new beans directly.
<h3>
<a NAME="activex-beans"></a>8.0 ActiveX Beans</h3>
Developers can use the BeanXporter functionality built-in to Telewindows2Toolit
to convert ActiveX controls on Windows NT/95/98 machines to Java beans.
These beans can then be imported into G2 and hosted on workspaces. Please
see the BeanXporter Users' Guide for more information about this functionality.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="demo"></a>9.0 Demo</h3>
Included in the T2T install is a demo of the Beans on Workspaces functionality.
To run the demo, execute the following script:
<ul>
<li>
On NT, %SEQUOIA_HOME%\Java\classes\com\gensym\demos\wkspbeans\rundemo.bat</li>

<li>
On Solaris, ${SEQUOIA_HOME}/classes/com/gensym/demos/wkspbeans/rundemo.sh</li>
</ul>
This brings up a G2 with the appropriate KB and opens a T2 client shell
to connect to it. There are 4 different demo workspaces that display different
levels of usage of the functionality:
<ol>
<li>
Chart Demo: shows how to push data to a 3rd-party charting tool.</li>

<li>
Button Demo: shows how to set up listeners for Java controls and handle
events from them.</li>

<li>
Widget Demo: shows how to hook up native controls to G2 data.</li>

<li>
ActiveX Demo (NT only):&nbsp; shows how to hookup the Microsoft Calendar
Control to a G2 application.</li>
</ol>
