MINOR API CHANGES
=================
Package: com.gensym.draw
1. in TextCell, TextBoxElement, and Paragraph, format(Graphics g) has been
   deprecated, with format(FontMetrics metrics) to be used instead.
2. Paragraph and TextLine have been made package private classes.

MAJOR FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES
===========================
1. Licensing is enforced for Telewindows2 connections. The licensing is based
   on instances of UI-CLIENT-INTERFACE and UI-CLIENT-SESSION. Every TwGateway,
   whether it be a third-tier TwRMIClientInterface or a plain 2-tier
   TwGateway, will consume a floating Telewindows license. For now, customers
   with no floating Telewindows licenses will be allowed one 
   Telewindows2 client to connect to a G2.
