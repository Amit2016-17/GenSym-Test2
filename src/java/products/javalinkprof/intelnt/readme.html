<U>Welcome to G2 JavaLink/Professional V1.0 Beta 0 for Windows NT</U></H1>

<H2>
Version 1 Rev 0 Internal Beta 0 Release Notes (Sep 1998)</H2>
This release will only work with G2 5.1 rev 0 (or later) G2 Javalink Gateway
V1.0 (or later) and Sun's JDK 1.1.6 (or later released <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/index.html">JDK
1.1.x Java Development Kit</A> ), which should be correctly installed on
your machine before using this software.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
G2 JavaLink Professional</H3>
G2 JavaLink/Professional provides;
<UL>
<LI>
Import of Java class definitions into G2.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
An imported Java Class maintains its class inheritance when imported into
G2, as JavaLink Professional will automatically import any classes and
interfaces found from the Java Classes inheritance definition.</LI>

<LI>
Method stubs are created for every public method and constructor found
using reflection. JavaLink Professional will automatically import any Java
Class definition required for classes used in method and constructor signatures.</LI>

<LI>
Imported Java Constructors can be called to create a G2 "proxy" for an
imported Java Class. An associated Java object associated with the proxy
can then be controlled from G2 by calling the imported method stubs.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Support for all Java types including arrays.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
G2 JavaLink/Professional complements G2 JavaLink/Gateway by providing additional
classes that allow all types and arrays to be sent between G2 and Java
visa versa.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
G2 Runtime Export</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
This very powerful feature enables a JavaLink Professional user to export
G2 classes and method behavior from G2 to the Java environment. JavaLink
Professional implements a G2-EXPORT-SERVICE that allows fundamental G2
foundation classes to be exported into a running Java VM. JavaLink Professional
also provides an implementation of a G2-RUNTIME that runs on a Java VM,
so that exported G2 classes can be created and controlled. This release
allows G2 CLASS-DEFINITIONs and their methods to be exported. Future releases
will allow other built classes to be exported (such as RULES and FUNCTIONS,
etc).</LI>

<LI>
G2 methods are exported&nbsp; using the G2Script Compiler ( <A HREF="docs/G2Script.html">See
G2Sscript Description</A> ). G2Script is a powerful subset of the G2 Language
specification, that can run within a Java VM.</LI>
</UL>

The \docs\api directory contain Javadoc output of the relevant Java classes
required to use G2 JavaLink Professional. Reading this documentation&nbsp;
in conjunction with the example classes supplied (i.e. com.gensym.demos.jlp.ExampleJLPGateway)

Setting Environmental Variables</H3>

<UL>In order for G2 JavaLink Professional to function, additions must be
made to the machines&nbsp; <B>CLASSPATH</B> environmental variable.

<P>While the InstallShield installation program is capable of make the
necessary changes to the environmental variables, this facility may be
vetoed by the installer.

<P><U>Note: The following instructions apply only if you elect <B>not</B>
to allow the JavaLink Professional install shield process to make JavaLink
Professional specific changes to the machines&nbsp; <B>CLASSPATH</B> environmental
variable for you.</U> Also, if you allow the JavaLink Professional install
shield process to perform the step for you (the default) then you must
reboot or logout/login for the changes to take effect.

<P>The following assumes that products have been installed in their default
location. Modifications should be made where appropriate when products
have been installed in an alternative directory.&nbsp; In addition it assumes
that <B>PATH</B> and <B>CLASSPATH</B> have already been set to reference
both the <B>JDK</B> and <B>G2</B> <B>Javalink/Gateway</B>.
<UL>
<UL>&nbsp;</UL>
</UL>

<LI>
Your&nbsp; <B>CLASSPATH</B> must be setup to point to the G2 JavaLink Professional&nbsp;
files.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
To setup your current NT session for all applications you must use the
<B>system</B> icon on the NT control panel. Select the ENVIRONMENT tab
and enter the following.</LI>

<H2>
<U>Problem Solving</U></H2>

<H3>
<U>General</U></H3>

<H4>
<U>(please refer to the current know problems/bugs list in KnownProblems.html)</U></H4>

<H4>
Memory Heap Size</H4>
The Java interpreter utilizes a memory heap for all object references and
values. When the heap becomes full, the interpreter will not try to allocate
any more memory, but will throw an OutOfMemoryException. If Java throws
an OutOfMemoryException while running a Java application or applet, then
try the Java interpreter's -ms option. e.g. <TT>java -mx20m classname</TT>
will increase the Java heap size from its default (currently 16meg) to
20meg.
<H4>
Java Thread Memory usage</H4>
Java on the NT platform creates a&nbsp; native NT thread for each java.lang.Thread
that is started. We have found that a significant amount of memory is allocated
for each thread that is created. Additionally, thread memory is not allocated
from the Java heap, but allocated from the overall processed memory.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<U>Problems when using Symantec's&nbsp; JIT supplied with the JDK1.1.6</U></H3>
We have not seen any significant problems when testing JavaLink with the
Symantec Just In Time Compiler (JIT) supplied (and turned on by default)
with JDK1.1.6. However, if you experience any unstability we would first
recommend that you run the JDK VM with the JIT turned off by using <B>java
-nojit classname, </B>and then retesting.
