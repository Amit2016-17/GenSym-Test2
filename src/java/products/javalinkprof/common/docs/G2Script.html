G2 Script Guide</H1>

<H2>
Introduction</H2>
G2Script is a subset of the G2 Programming Language which is compiled into
Java class files. It can be easily used as a scripting language in Java
deployment environments for users of G2.&nbsp; It can also be used to export
parts of G2 Knowledge Bases to Java Virtual machine, typically as agents
of the G2 server.&nbsp; The definition and implementation of G2Script is
based on the semantics of the G2 programming language and the Java Virtual
Machine.&nbsp; G2Script does not rely upon JavaLink.&nbsp; It does, however,
provide open interfaces for the implementation of a compile-time environment
that allow JavaLink, or any other system, to override the default behavior
regarding the lookup of classes on the classpath, handling of namespaces,
etc.

<P>G2Script's coverage of the G2 Language will grow from release to release.&nbsp;
Because it is a true subset of G2 and that the definitions of binary compatibility
in Java are well-established forward migration is assured.&nbsp; Early
releases of G2Script do not address some of the more difficult compatibility
issues.&nbsp; Most of these issues, like G2's global namespace or threading
model, will be addressed through user-selectable features in the compilation
and/or execution environments.&nbsp;&nbsp; These compatibility modes are
still in design; it is hoped that the number of these switches is limited.

<P>Readers of this document must be familiar with the G2 programming language.&nbsp;
There are some sections of the document that present detailed information
about Java compatibility.&nbsp; These sections will be confined for the
most part the appendices and can be safely ignore by readers who want to
use G2Script, rather than understand the subtleties of its implementation,
compilation, and deployment.

<P>G2 and G2Script example code will be shown in a sans serif, e.g. "<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">smoked-gouda
:class cheese;</FONT>".&nbsp; Java will be shown in monospaced, "t1.<TT>fillTank(desiredLevel)</TT>".&nbsp;
In syntax descriptions, braces "{}" delimit optional syntax "*", "+" are
postfix modifiers for zero-or-more and one-or-more respectively.&nbsp;
Syntactic variables are shown as "&lt;statement>".&nbsp; Plain-text parentheses,
"(" and ")" are used for grouping and vertical bar "|" for alternatives.
<H2>
Procedures and Methods</H2>
G2Script provides procedures in methods in much the same manner as G2.
Some errors that are caught at compile time in G2 are caught at runtime
in G2Script, and vice-versa.&nbsp; This is done to provide some leeway
in the implementation, while not changing (correct) application behavior.

<P>The set of methods of a given name over the class hierarchy must have
the same return type specification.&nbsp; This (sadly) is not true in G2.&nbsp;
This not considered to be a great loss, as good object-oriented use of
G2 would rarely or never exploit this "feature".

<P>Multiple return values are not supported in G2Script.
<H3>
Parameters, Variables, and Data Types</H3>
G2Script presents the same type system and class hierarchy to users as
G2. The exceptions are:

<P>For the <B>integer</B> type, the range of the integer is 32 bits in
G2Script, as opposed to 30 bits in G2.

<P>For the <B>float</B> type, the G2 script implementation is always a
IEEE-754 double.&nbsp; The G2 implementation is allowed to have two fewer
bits in the mantissa (is this perfectly accurate?).

<P>For the <B>truth-value</B> type, fuzzy truth values are not yet supported.

<P>The <B>class</B> type is supported with two exceptions.&nbsp; One is
that the full G2 class hierarchy is not available in G2Script.&nbsp; One
cannot "<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">create a trend-chart my-tc;</FONT>".&nbsp;
The other exception is a more a convention.&nbsp; Class names that follow
the normal hyphenation style of G2 developers are assumed to be classes
that came from G2 and/or created from G2Script.&nbsp; Classes that are
proceeded by a package-prefix, "<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">foo :class
java.lang.string-buffer</FONT>" are assumed to be classes that came fundamentally
from Java.&nbsp; Even though this class name seems a like a strange symbol,
veteran G2 programmers know that periods are allowable symbol characters.
<H3>
Supported Statements</H3>
<B>&lt;actions></B>

<P>All actions are useable as statements within procedures.&nbsp; Please
see the section on actions &lt;link> for details.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">allow other processing</FONT></B>

<P>The allow-other-processing statement does nothing in the current implementation
of G2Script.&nbsp; If and when a compatibility switch for the G2 threading
model (a.k.a cooperative threading) is implemented, it will have the same
meaning it does in G2.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">begin</FONT></B> &lt;statement>* <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">end</FONT></B>
{<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">on</FONT></B> <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">error</FONT></B>
(&lt;symbol>, &lt;text>) &lt;statement>* <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">end
</FONT></B>}

<P>Begin-end blocks have the same behavior as it does in G2.&nbsp; The
G2 5.0 one-argument on-error clause is not yet supported.&nbsp; For top
level begin-end blocks that use the optional on-error block, G2Script enforces
compatible return types between both blocks at runtime.&nbsp; In G2 this
is not caught until runtime, but always signals.&nbsp; It is assumed that
this not necessary compatibility because no sane application wants to catch
and recover from syntax errors.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>{&lt;local-variable> <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">=</FONT></B> }
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">call </FONT></B>&lt;constant-symbol> <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">(</FONT></B>&lt;expression>+<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">)</FONT></B>
<BR>{&lt;local-variable> <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">=</FONT></B> }
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">call the procedure named by the </FONT></B>&lt;symbol-expression>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">of the class-methods of </FONT></B>&lt;definition>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">(</FONT></B>&lt;expression>*<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">)</FONT></B>

<P>Two forms of the call statement are supported in G2.&nbsp; The first
corresponds to instance method calling, where the first argument must have
some class is type.&nbsp; The second corresponds to static method invocation.&nbsp;
The syntax is somewhat stilted, but preserves G2 compatibility.&nbsp; Zero
or one local variables may be assigned from the result of a call.&nbsp;
The compile-time checking of call assignments may be stricter in G2Script
than G2.

<P>Evaluated expressions to produce a procedure object is not support in
G2Script.&nbsp; Methods are not first-class objects in Java; creating this
illusion would be difficult for implementation and slow at runtime.&nbsp;
The Java reflectio Method class does not provide a viable alternative feature
here, as it is not implemented be even close the normally virtual machine
method invocation in speed.

<P>Calling accross interfaces is not supported.&nbsp; There may be a future
compatibility switch to allow such calling to map into RMI calls and/or
JavaLink calls.

<P>The on-error local variable bindings get the class name of exception
and the message of the exception respectively.

<P>&lt;local-variable> <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">=</FONT></B> &lt;expression>

<P>Assignment is fully supported, including casting.&nbsp; The assignment
operator in G2 does implicit casting. For example:

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">x :item-or-value;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">y:class java.awt.event.mouse-event;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">begin</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; { some code }</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; y = x;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; { more code }</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">end</FONT>

<P>will work the same as it does in G2.&nbsp; This means either the (casting)
assignment succeeds because x contain a java.awt.event.MouseEvent, or an
error will be signalled.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">exit if</FONT></B> &lt;logical-expresion>

<P>Exit-if works the same as it does in G2.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">for</FONT></B> &lt;integer-variable>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">=</FONT></B> &lt;integer> <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">to</FONT></B>|<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">down
to</FONT></B> &lt;integer> { <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">by</FONT></B>
&lt;integer> }

<P>For-loops support only integer iteration.&nbsp; It may support class
iteration in the future under a compatibility switch that will state whether
the instances of a class are enumerable at runtime in a given environment.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">if</FONT></B> &lt;logical-expresion>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">then</FONT></B> &lt;statement> {<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">else</FONT></B>
&lt;statement>}

<P>If works the same as it does in G2.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">repeat</FONT></B> &lt;statement>* <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">end</FONT></B>

<P>Repeat-blocks work the same as in G2.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">return</FONT></B> {&lt;expression>}

<P>is limited to returning 0 or 1 items or values.&nbsp; The checking of
the use of returns versus procedure declaration is more stringent in G2Script
than in G2.&nbsp; This is feature, not a bug, because G2's laxity in this
regard merely puts off syntax error detection until runtime.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">signal</FONT></B> &lt;symbol-expression><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">,
</FONT></B>&lt;text-expression>

<P>Signal is supported.&nbsp; The G2 5.0 one-arg version of signal will
be supported in a future release.

<P>Java Note:&nbsp; The two-arg version of signal will create an exception
of type com.gensym.g2scriptruntime.G2ScriptException.

<P>wait for (&lt;time-constant> | &lt;quantity-expression>)

<P>One form of G2's wait statement is currently supported in G2 script,
waiting for a specific amount of time.&nbsp; Waiting for other conditions
is very similar to the event-detection that G2 whenever rules perform,
and is being developed
<BR>for a later release.
<H2>
Actions</H2>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">conclude that the</FONT></B> &lt;attribute-name>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">of</FONT></B> &lt;item-expression> ( <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">=</FONT></B>
&lt;expression> | <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">has no value</FONT></B>)
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">conclude that the</FONT></B> &lt;attribute-name>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">of the class-fields of</FONT></B> &lt;definition-expression>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">=</FONT></B> &lt;expression>
| <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">has no value</FONT></B>)
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">conclude that </FONT></B>&lt;expression>[&lt;integer-expression>]
( <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">=</FONT></B> &lt;expression> | <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">has
no value</FONT></B>)

<P>Conclude supports attribute and array references currently.&nbsp; Concluding
into variables is not supported and will not be until a compatibility switch
for global name spaces is provided.&nbsp; Collection times are not yet
supported and will be if and when support for G2-style variables and parameters
with histories is introduced.&nbsp; Concluding symbols with "is &lt;symbol>"
rather than "= the symbol &lt;symbol>" is not yet supported.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">create</FONT></B> (<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">a</FONT></B>|<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">an</FONT></B>)
&lt;class-name-expression> &lt;local-variable>

<P>The create action is supported.&nbsp; It is required that local variables
be assigned.&nbsp; This will cause the zero-arg constructor of a given
class to fire.&nbsp; For the ability to refer to other constructors, please
see &lt;link>.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">delete</FONT></B> &lt;item-expression>

<P>Delete is support, in a fashion.&nbsp; Java-aware readers will immediately
recognize that Java does not support explicit de-allocation of objects,
offering garbage collection instead.&nbsp; Because G2 programs rely on
the fact that local variables that point at objects that are deleted are
said to no longer "exist" (as in G2's exists operator), delete is made
to function that has as "conclude that the &lt;item-expression> has no
value".&nbsp; This is illustrated in the following example:

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">begin</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; create a my-object x;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; delete x;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; if x exists</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then inform the operator
that "if you're seeing this message, then G2 is broken"</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else infrom the operator
that "if you're seeing this message, then G2 is working correctly";</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">end</FONT>

<P>The "removing connection stubs" and "without permanence checks" are
not yet supported.&nbsp; If they are supported, they are likely to be no-ops.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">inform the operator that</FONT></B>
&lt;text-expression>

<P>One form, the most common, of the inform action is supported.&nbsp;
This currently writes its results to Java's standard output stream.&nbsp;
Two future extensions to this are envisioned.&nbsp; One is to let applications
handle where output goes through a callback interface.&nbsp; The second,
which depends on the first, is to allow "inform &lt;item-expression> that
&lt;text-expression>", where the items would somehow be associated with
different handlers provided by the user.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">start </FONT></B>&lt;constant-symbol>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">(</FONT></B>&lt;expression>+<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">)
</FONT></B>{<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">at priority</FONT></B> &lt;integer>}
{ <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">after</FONT></B> &lt;quanitity-expression>
}
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">start the procedure named by the </FONT></B>&lt;symbol-expression>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">of the class-methods of </FONT></B>&lt;definition>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">(</FONT></B>&lt;expression>*<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">)
</FONT></B>{<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">at priority</FONT></B> &lt;integer>}
{ <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">after</FONT></B> &lt;quanitity-expression>
}

<P>Start is supported.&nbsp; See the section on call &lt;link> for details
on the procedure object and arguments.&nbsp; Priority suffixes are ignored.&nbsp;
Delay suffixes are supported.
<H2>
Expressions</H2>
The primary arithmetic operators on quantity-expressions (+, -, *, and
/) are supported.
<BR>Relation operations (=, /=, &lt;=, >=, &lt;, >) and logical operations
(and, or, not) are as well.

<P>&lt;attribute-name> OF ( &lt;item-expression> | &lt;structure-expression>
)

<P>Attribute reference, "OF" is supported for attributes of items and structures.&nbsp;
The "named by", (aka evaluated) form of attribute reference is not yet
supported.

<P>&lt;array-expression>, <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">[</FONT></B>&lt;integer-expression><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">]</FONT></B>

<P>array reference, [&lt;integer>], is supported for both arrays and sequences.
<BR>&nbsp; [arrays refs are still under constructio in current beta]

<P>&lt;item-expression> <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">is</FONT></B> {
not } the same item as &lt;item-expression>

<P>Most forms of the "is" operator are supported, with "is an instance
of the class named by &lt;symbol-expression>", "is &lt;relation-name> &lt;item-expression>"
being the notable exceptions.

<P>&lt;item-expression> { <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">exists</FONT></B>
| <B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">does not exist</FONT></B> }

<P>The exists operator is implemented, although in the current release
it does not check n levels of failure to exist safely.
<BR>Fortunately 99% of the use of exists is one-level, e.g. "if the foo
of bar exists then ...".

<P>The special structure(name1 : value1, name2 : value2, ...) constructor
is implemented

<P>"the current real time" and "the current subsecond real time" are supported.&nbsp;
"the current time" is not supported because it refers to the G2 scheduler
clock, rather than the operating system clock.&nbsp; In the future, parts
of the G2 scheduler may be supported or reflected in G2Script.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
Functions</H2>
Function support is nearly complete.&nbsp; Included groups are:

<P>Arithmetic
<BR>Bitwise Logical Operations
<BR>Quantity
<BR>Symbol
<BR>Text
<BR>Time

<P>The connection evaluation functions, call-function (the function-calling
function), and user-defined functions are not supported.&nbsp; Connection-evaluation
functions depend on the existence of workspace, connections and are not
currently under consideration.&nbsp; Call-function and user defined functions
are being considered.
<H2>
Literals/Constants</H2>
Text constants do not yet support the escape sequences of G2, such as "@L"
for new lines.&nbsp; All other constants are supported the same.&nbsp;
While not a constant in the true sense, embedded values in texts, e.g "<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Foo
is [foo]</FONT>" is supported.
<H2>
Efficiency Considerations</H2>

<H3>
Data Type Specificity</H3>
The execution efficiency of G2Script depends almost entirely on the specificity
of local variable types in methods in procedures.&nbsp; Variances of 1
or 2 orders of magnitude can be expected between generic and specific code.&nbsp;
For example

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">p1()</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">x1, x2, x3 :item-or-value;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">f1, f2, f3 :float;</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">begin</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; { omitted code }</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; x1 = x2 + x3;&nbsp; { statement
1 }</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; f1 = f2 + f3;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
{ statement 2 }</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">end</FONT>

<P>has both generic and specific arithmetic.&nbsp; The first statement
will always call a method that in turn does some type checking.&nbsp; The
latter will compile to a single java virtual machine instruction.&nbsp;
In many Java implementations this may become a hardware instruction that
could be executed in parallel and/or pipelined with other instructions.&nbsp;
Ratios of 100-to-, and even higher, between statement-1 and statement-2
are quite possible.

<P>The above example is just one case.&nbsp; The rule in general is to
limit the use of the item-or-value, value, and quantity data-types in G2
and G2Script.&nbsp; If such types much be used, they should not be in time-critical
code, and if so they should be analyzed and subcased into type-specific
code.
<H3>
Compile-Time Visibility of Methods and Attributes</H3>
Another general area of efficiency consideration is around the visibility
of attributes and methods at compile time.&nbsp; G2 allows code to refer
to variables, attributes, methods, and procedures that do not currently
exist.&nbsp; G2 penalizes the execution efficiency such references and
calls in all cases (modulo stability declarations, but then only to a degree)
to provide this flexibility.&nbsp; In G2Script this issue is addressed
by breaking each reference or call into two cases.&nbsp; One is the "blessed"
case where the reference is findable at compile time and has the proper
data types.&nbsp; This will compile into the lowest level java virtual
machine primitives.&nbsp; References and calls that do not meet this criteria
are compiled into runtime lookups.&nbsp; G2Script has a small kernel of
runtime operations that perform calls, attribute references, et cetera,
through the java.lang.reflect.API.
<H3>
Interface Classes</H3>
G2Script allows the use of interface classes.&nbsp; It should be noted
that interface method invocation is slower than instance method invocation.&nbsp;
Various Java implementors claim that this will be addressed in future releases
of their Virtual Machines.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
Appendix A: Compilation Interfaces</H2>
The G2Script compiler is itself an object, an instance of com.gensym.g2script.Compiler.&nbsp;
To compile G2Script source code, one must make an instance of a compiler
and call one of the variants of compileMethod.&nbsp; The compiler object
accumalates environment information and can and should be used to compile
multiple methods of multiple classes.&nbsp; The G2Script compiler works
in tandem with com.gensym.classtools.&nbsp; Classtools is a module that
allows one to build Java classes from nested data structures, representing
fields, methods, statements, expressions, constants, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
top-level representation class in Classtools is ClassInfo, which is used
to hold a class as it is being built.&nbsp; ClassInfo's can either be written
to files or loaded into memory directly by a java.lang.ClassLoader.&nbsp;
Please refer to the Javadoc for Classtools for details.

<P>The G2Script compilation interface (on com.gensym.Compiler) is:

<P>public MethodInfo compileMethod(String methodText, ClassInfo uncompiledClass)
<BR>&nbsp; throws CompilerException

<P>public MethodInfo compileMethod(java.io.Reader reader,&nbsp; ClassInfo
uncompiledClass,&nbsp;&nbsp; boolean verbose)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; throws CompilerException

<P>The G2Script compiler can make use of more detailed information about
the target deployment environment&nbsp; interface called com.gensym.g2script.ClassInfoFactory.&nbsp;
Classnames in G2Script that do not contain package qualification, can be
resolved by a ClassInfoFactory, as well as providing a means of resolving
circular compile-time dependencies.&nbsp; This interface is used by JavaLink
to allow G2Script to follow JavaLink naming and package conventions.&nbsp;
This interface is not perfectly set in stone yet.&nbsp; Parties with an
interest in controlling compile-time naming should contact the G2Script
developers.
<H2>
Appendix B: Runtime Interfaces</H2>
The package com.gensym.g2scriptruntime provides runtime suport for G2Script.&nbsp;
It contains a class, Kernel, which has a few interfaces for configuring
the execution of G2Script.&nbsp; They include

<P>public static void setBaseRealTime(long newBaseTime)

<P>This method controls the base-time of "the current {subsecond} time"
expression in G2.&nbsp; Its argument should be the number of milliseconds
since midnight, January 1,&nbsp; 1970.&nbsp; The default base time is unspecified,
which is no impediment to using the current real time for interval timing
purposes.

<P>public static void setDomain(NamingService namingService)

<P>The setDomain method allows a naming service to be specified, to provide
a global name space for G2Script that emulates G2's namespace.&nbsp; The
use of namespaces is important for rules and a few other G2 expressions
and actions.&nbsp; These facilities are in alpha stage of development.&nbsp;
Most users, aside from alpha and beta testers of JavaLink Professional,
should not worry about this interface.
