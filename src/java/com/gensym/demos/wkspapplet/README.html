Workspace Applet</H1></CENTER>
Workspaces can be displayed in applets through the use of the Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP>
Plug-in. This demonstration shows a fairly simple way of showing any workspace
from any G2 in an applet.

<P><A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/">Java Plug-in</A> is a
Netscape Plug-in or Explorer ActiveX object written by Sun Microsystems.
It displays applets using the Java Runtime Environment (or JRE) version
1.1.X, rather than using the browser's own Java Virtual Machine. If you
don't already have the Java Plug-in installed, then when you follow the
link to the applet, you will be guided through the installation process
for the Plug-in.

<P>To run the demo, click on the following link.

Warning:</H3>
If you have installed Netscape's patch for awt1.1, displaying a popup (i.e.,
clicking the right mouse button anywhere on the workspace), will result
in an application error. You do not need the awt1.1 patch to run the Plug-in.
