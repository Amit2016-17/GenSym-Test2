Modification of G2 Bean Builder

Where modification of G2 Bean Builder code does not involve the physical layout/composition of the GUI, 
java files may be loaded into an editor such as EMACS. Where changes to the GUI are needed, it is often easier to 
make these changes while the code is loaded into an IDE such as Symantecs' VisualCafe.

Only the .java , resource files and image files for G2 Bean Builder are stored under CVS. Project files for IDE's 
such as VisualCafe are not stored. 

This document outlines the steps that need to be taken in order to load   G2 Bean Builder into VisualCafe.

(1) extract the G2 Bean Builder source code from CVS
   
three directories need to be created:
   	com\gensym\beanbuilder
   	com\gensym\beanbuilder\images
   	com\gensym\beanbuilder\text

the first holds the .java files, the second holds the image files for the GUI and the latter holds the resource files 
for the GUI internationalization.


(2) Ensure that the CLASSPATH and PATH settings of the sc.ini file found in the Visual Cafe\bin directory are modified 
to relect the location of the G2 Bean Builder code 
	e.g.   c:\bt\jp\java

(3) Compile all the java files. (Symantec VisualCafe produces depecated code) 

(4) Create a new project() in Symantec VisualCafe. 

(5) Select the Project-Options menu choice. This will display a dialog box. Within the 
"Show diretories for classfiles option" add an entry to reflect the location of the bean builder source
	e.g. c:\bt\jp\java

(6) Select the Insert-Component into library menu option and
insert class com.gensym.ImageDisplay. This class is used by the G2 Bean Builder to display its graphics images. 
The action of inserting this class into the newly created project will facilitate the loading of the remainder of the 
G2 Bean Builder code. If this step is omitted, the ImageDisplay objects within the GUI are not re-created.

(7) Delete all of the objects from the Project window.

(8) Select the Insert-Files into Project menu option and add the following files:-
	
	G2BeanBuilder.java
	AboutDialog.java
	AttentionDialog.java
	ConfirmDialog.java

Check the Message window to see that the files were all correctly added to the project.

When all the files have been added, double click on the G2BeanBuilder component of the project. 
This should display the G2BeanBuilder GUI. If the backgroud image is not visible, DO NOT save the project / files. 
In all probability, the ImageDisplay.class has not been found, as a result, all of the ImageDisplay instances will have 
been lost from the code. Close down Symantec Cafe and try again.


(9) Select File-Save As menu option and specify a file name for the project e.g. G2BBB2
Note it has been observed that from the stage of inserting the class com.gensym.ImageDisplay into VC sometimes fails 
(bug in VC?)

In the event of this happening, all subsequent attempt to load the class and hence G2 Bean Builder will fail. 
The only resolution to this problem appears to be to re install SVC.
