<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>Allan Scott</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1>September 1998</FONT><U><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></U>

<P>The features described below are those that have been the most requested
in the last 3 months of BeanXporter Beta testing
<BR>and 1.0 use.&nbsp; I have tried to describe in as much detail how I
intended to add these features.&nbsp; Since I never implemented these
<BR>features the proposed solutions may not work, but I hope they will
give useful pointers.

<P>To read and understand this documentation you will need to have read
the following doc:
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>Completing Data Type Coverage</U>

<P>The following table shows the most important remaining data types that
need to be addressed.&nbsp; Key to adding all of these
<BR>in a maintainable way will be to continue jv's declarative approach
to define handlers for receiving and sending each
<BR>data type.&nbsp; Currently this work is done in case statements by
vartypes.c: make_jobject_from_variant() and dispatch.c:
<BR>create_dispparams.

<TD>Description of Problem</TD>

<TD>Proposed Solution</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>VT_BYREF&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>The ability to pass and receive all other data types by reference.&nbsp;

<P>VT_BYREF is a bitflag that can be included in the vtype of a VARIANT.&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>C Code:
<BR>vartypes.c, make_jobject_from_variant()
<BR>recognize that the VT_BYREF flag has been included.&nbsp; If it has
been included then for each vtype get the value by reference.&nbsp; For
example to get an int by reference use the piVal member of VARIANT rather
than the iVal member

<P>dispatch.c,&nbsp; create_dispparams
<BR>recognize that the VT_BYREF flag has been included.&nbsp; If it has
been included then need to create a parallel data structure to store pointers
to the type value that is being sent.

<P>dispatch.c, Java_com_gensym_com_ActiveXProxy_com_1Invoke
<BR>Support is also&nbsp; needed to retrieve what is pointed to after a
call to Invoke.&nbsp; To do this after Invoke traverse the parallel data-structure
that was created by create_dispparams and then call setXValue methods on
the Java Variant to set the value back into the Java Variant.

<P>Java Code:
<BR>Add another constant to ActiveXRuntimeConstants called AX_BYREF.&nbsp;
It will have to be an int.
<BR>Change the type used by Variant to be an int rather than a short.&nbsp;
This will require making some methods obsolete.
<BR>Add setXValue methods, where X is the names of the types of data that
Variant can contain, eg setFloatValue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>VT_CUR</TD>

<TD>&nbsp;Ole CURRENCY type</TD>

<TD>C Code:
<BR>dispatch.c, create_dispparams()
<BR>vartypes.c, make_jobject_from_variant()
<BR>Both need to handle VT_CUR type.

<P>Java Code:
<BR>Add com.gensym.com.Currency to closely mimic the Ole data type</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>VT_SAFEARRAY</TD>

<TD>Support N-dimensional arrays being passed from Java to ActiveX and
visa-versa.</TD>

<TD>C Code:
<BR>dispatch.c, create_dispparams()
<BR>Recognize that a VT_SAFEARRAY type is being sent

<P>vartypes.c, make_jobject_from_variant()
<BR>Recognize that a VT_SAFEARRAY type is being received.

<P>autojava.c, add a get_safearray_value()
<BR>This will take a jobject that represents an N-dimensional array of
com.gensym.com.Variant objects and convert it into a SAFEARRAY object.&nbsp;
It will have to call SafeArrayCreate and will need to be able to add individual
values into the array

<P>autojava.c,&nbsp; create_java_array()
<BR>This will take a SAFEARRAY and will return an array of com.gensym.com.Variant's
of the appropriate dimensions.&nbsp; It will have to call various Variant
constructors for various data types.

<P>Note that SAFEARRAY's can also be passed by pointer, so implementing
this will also require integration with the work to support VT_BYREF</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>VT_DATE</TD>

<TD>This currently is implemented.&nbsp; There is a bug in BeanXporter
1.0 with the conversion between OLE Date and java.util.Date.&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>Java code: Variant.java
<BR>C code: dispatch.c, create_dispparams
<BR>vartypes.c,&nbsp; make_jobject_from_variant,
<BR>vartypes.c: date_value

<P>Between these locations a consistent two way conversion must be supported.</TD>

<P><U>Creation Shortcuts</U><U></U>

<P>A class com.gensym.com.ActiveXClassFactory should be created.&nbsp;
It would have the following methods:

<P>ActiveXDispatchable create(Guid clsid);

<P>ActiveXDispatchable create(String progID);

<P>ActiveXDispatchable get(Guid clsid);

<P>ActiveXDispatchable get(String progID);

<P>This implementation of the create() methods should do the two following
things:
<OL>
<LI>
Locate the appropriate Java class that wraps the component, and create
one of those</LI>

<LI>
If there is no appropriate Java class to wrap the component then create
the component generically.</LI>
</OL>
Either ActiveXModes will need to be modified to support passing in a progID
String rather than a Guid or the
<BR>implementation of&nbsp; create(String progID) will need to call a native
method to get the appropriate Guid.

<P>The trick of locating the appropriate Java class that wraps a specific
class will requre some sort of a registration mechanism.
<BR>Without locating the appropriate Java class, the best that can be offered
for the user it the ability to "cast" to the class that
<BR>they want by using a constructor that takes ActiveXDispatchable.

<P>Note that all these methods return ActiveXDispatchable rather than ActiveXComponent.&nbsp;
That is because these
<BR>should not be restricted to the creation of CO_CLASS components.&nbsp;
In many ActiveX API's it is possible to create
<BR>interfaces (TKIND_DISPATCH, TKIND_INTERFACE, etc) directly rather than
through using QuerInterface)().

<P>The get() methods are necessary for the case where a user is planning
to&nbsp; connect to an already created ActiveX
<BR>component.&nbsp; In the C implementation of get() the running object
table must be checked to see whether an instance
<BR>of that Guid has already been created and registered as running.<U></U>

<P>The creation shortcuts features are among the most commonly requested
because they reflect expectations that
<BR>are set by using Visual Basic and also the structure of many ActiveX
API's.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>Support for Reflection</U>

<P>BeanXporter will emit the methods of components that implement IUnknown
and IDispatch.&nbsp; It is therefore fairly
<BR>common to find QueryInterface() and friends in the Java files produced
by BeanXporter.

<P>In BeanXporter 1.0 a number of factors conspire to make most of the
reflection methods unusable.&nbsp; It is important
<BR>to make them useable because they provide a degree of reflection that
is often necessary to get an ActiveX API
<BR>to work.

<P>The main thing that will be required to get these reflection methods
to work is support for VT_BYREF.
<BR>QueryInterface in particular returns result by changing the IUknown
component that one of it's arguments
<BR>points to.

<P>Greater support for reflection has been the major feature request of
OptimaSoft, our most enthusiastic
<BR>customer.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>Property Binding</U><U></U>

<P>BeanXporter 1.0 provides the ability to add listeners to arbitrary ActiveX
event sources.

<P>When this was conceived I also wanted to add the ability to listen to
property change events in ActiveX
<BR>components.

<P>In ActiveX the IPropertyNotify and IPropertyNotifySink interfaces provide
special support for property binding.

<P>At emit-time BeanXporter must emit an addPropertyChangeListener and
removePropertyChangeListener method for every ActiveXComponent that supports
property binding.

<P>At run-time the ActiveXProxy object must provide the ability to register
a PropertyChangeListener.

<P>See "Notes on Implementing an OLE Control Container”&nbsp; Kraig Brockshmidt,
Microsoft Developer Relations, MSDN Library
<BR>for information on how to implement this facility.

<P>Also see the stub functions in events.c that show where I was thinking
of implementing this facility.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>Architecture Thoughts</U>

<P>Think of the com.gensym.com API in terms of the following object-oriented
design patterns:

<P>Bridge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interfaces ActiveXComponent, ActiveXDisplayComponent
and ActiveXDispatchable allow these
<BR>to be implemented in multiple ways.

<P>Proxy:&nbsp; ActiveXGenericComponent, and the Java classes that are
emitted by BeanXporters are examples of
<BR>proxy's.&nbsp; They are essentially stubs that wrap COM components.

<P>The actual ActiveXProxy class itself is an overweight workhorse that
would have benefited by being an Impl class
<BR>and broken up into various Bridge pattern interfaces.

<P>Another way to look at the com.gensym.com API is in terms of it's representational
capacity.&nbsp; What percentage
<BR>of ActiveX data can be represented using com.gensym.com.&nbsp; The
nearer we are to being able to represent as
<BR>much data as something like Visual Basic the better shape we are in.

<P>Another way to look at the com.gensym.com.API is in terms of the lifecycle
of the components.&nbsp; How well does it
<BR>support creation, activation (in-place, out of place), display, peristence,
deletion, etc. relative to a tool like
<BR>Visual Basic?
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><U>Performance Thoughts</U><U></U>

<P>The marshalling of data from Java to ActiveX in BeanXporter 1.0 seems
excessively slow.&nbsp; Things to consider:
<OL>
<LI>
The use of Vector, probably Variant[] should have been used from the start</LI>

<LI>
Push data into the C code rather than pull from the C code.</LI>

<LI>
Relative performance with JIT's</LI>

<LI>
Profiling with an advanced tool</LI>

<LI>
The cost of the multi-apartment model vs the use of the free-threading
model</LI>
</OL>


<P><U>Most Commonly Requested Crazy Things</U><U></U>

<P>These are all crazy requests.&nbsp; Sooner or later someone will embark
on solving them, since the demand
<BR>to solve crazy problems is always high:<U></U>

<P>Support for running BeanXporter from inside an applet.&nbsp; BeanXporter
requires a runtime dll which, unless it
<BR>has already been installed on the machine using it, will not be available
in an applet.&nbsp; The best hope of being
<BR>able to run in applets in the future would be that Sun decide's to
bundle BeanXporter with activator.&nbsp; This seems
<BR>unlikely, but you never know.

<P>Support for running BeanXporter on non-Windows platforms.&nbsp; Crazy
though this seems it is a fairly common
<BR>request.&nbsp; One idea to quiten these requests is to have BeanXporter
use rmic to create RMI stubs during the emit.
<BR>This would allow ActiveX controls wrapped by BeanXporter on a Windows
machine to be accessed and controlled
<BR>from&nbsp; a non-Windows machine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another idea is to convert
BeanXporter with a tool like MainWin from Main
<BR>software.&nbsp; That would allow BeanXporter to run on other platforms
with components there that have also been
<BR>converted for those other platforms.

<P>Support for running BeanXporter inside Microsofts VM.&nbsp; Microsoft's
VM does not currently support JNI.&nbsp; Microsoft
<BR>has a comparable tool JActiveX, which covers much of the functionality
of BeanXporter.&nbsp; Nevertheless people have
<BR>asked for this.
