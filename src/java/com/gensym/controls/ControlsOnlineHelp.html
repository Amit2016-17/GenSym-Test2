Telewindows2 Dialog Controls Online Guide</H1>
TODO LIST
<BR>- links to API documents
<BR>- canonical dialog examples
<BR>- editing cookbook
<BR>- notes on internationalization

<P>&nbsp;This document presents a high-level description of the properties,
events, and methods of the standard dialog controls that come with Telewindows2.&nbsp;
Only the features that are visible in non-expert mode are described.&nbsp;
These features should be sufficient to build dialogs to edit nearly any
attribute of any G2 Item.&nbsp; This Guide is intended to be used in conjunction
with the Telewindows2 ComponentEditor.&nbsp; For a more in-depth look at
these controls please refer to the &lt;Tag com.gensym.controls api doc>.

<P>These controls are optimized for building dialogs to edit and browse
the values in the attributes of G2 Items.&nbsp; Such item-editing dialogs
are special, in that they are managed used by WorkspaceViews to provide
a dialog for the properties menu choice on the items on workspaces.&nbsp;
Item-editing dialogs can be associated with G2 Classes, user modes, client
locales (for internationalization), or even with specific instances of
classes.&nbsp; This association is maintained by the TwAccess object that
owns the workspace view.&nbsp; Consult its documentation &lt;TAG>, or the
Blah-Blah book for more information.

<P>The controls (referred to alternatively as components) are defined by
their properties, events, and methods.&nbsp; Simple, yet powerful, customized
dialogs can be built with these components by configuring their properties,
and connecting their events that they generate to call methods in other
components.&nbsp; This control set makes use of equivalently named events
and methods, to emphasize the patterns in which these controls are typically
connected.

<H1>
<IMG SRC="item_proxy.gif" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32>&nbsp; ItemProxy</H1>
The ItemProxy is an invisible control that stands in for a G2 Item.&nbsp;
It does not represent any specific G2 Item, but rather a set of attributes
that should be available on some item. This is done to promote the re-usability
of dialogs.&nbsp; This set of attributes is the client side state of the
object.&nbsp; It can be maintained in synch with the G2 Item or can be
used to batch up a set of changes.&nbsp; The item which is the ItemProxy
currently represents at run-time is called the <I>associated item</I>.

<P>ItemProxies have a special function when dialogs are launched.&nbsp;
After the dialog has been built, but before it is shown on the screen each
item proxy on the dialog is linked with its associated item.&nbsp; If more
than proxy is on a dialog, the name property of the proxy can be used to
sort out which proxy goes with which item.&nbsp; Please see &lt;Tag dialoglauncher>
for details.
<H2>
Properties</H2>

<H3>
attributeNames</H3>
attributeNames is a set of Symbols that name attributes of a G2 Item.&nbsp;
This set is usually a subset of the attributes seen in G2.&nbsp; This property
must be filled for the ItemProxy to have any useful function.
<H3>
autoDownload</H3>
The autoDownload property controls whether this ItemProxy will generate
objectUpdated events when the underlying G2 item has a change in one of
its attributes.
<H3>
autoUpload.</H3>
The autoUpload property controls whether this ItemProxy upload data to
G2, via the upload method, whenever it receives and objectChanged event.
<H3>
name</H3>
The name property allows multiple ItemProxies in the same dialog to be
distinguished by the dialog launcher.&nbsp; It need not be filled when
a single proxy is in use.
<H3>
subObjectAttributeName</H3>
The subObjectAttributeName field should be filled when the ItemProxy is
being used to represent an item that resides in an attribute of another
item.&nbsp; This slot would then contain the name of that attribute from
the parent item.
<H2>
Events Generated</H2>

<H3>
objectUpdated</H3>
The ItemProxy generates an objectUpdated event when the download method
is called or if autoDownload is true AND the ItemProxy's associated G2
Item changes.&nbsp; This event is typically linked to call the objectUpdated
method in other Telewindows controls.
<H2>
Methods</H2>

<H3>
download()</H3>
The download method forces a download of the set of attribute values from
G2 into the proxy.&nbsp; The local copy is updated.&nbsp; objectChanged
events are propagated to any connected components.
<H3>
editItem()</H3>
The editItem method launches the same dialog that the would be launched
from the WorkspaceView for the associated G2 Item.&nbsp; This can be either
a Gensym-generated dialog or a customized dialog.&nbsp; This choice is
governed by the DialogManager of the T2Access connection object.&nbsp;
See &lt;TAG DialogManager> documentation for details.
<H3>
itemRetrieved(ItemRetrievalEvent)</H3>
This method is typically called to handle an itemRetrieved event from an
ItemRetriever.&nbsp; When it is called it associates the ItemProxy with
the retrieved item and then calls the download method.

<P>itemRetrievalFailed(ItemRetrievalEvent)

<P>The itemRetrievalFailed method is typically called to handle an itemRetrievalFailed
event from an ItemRetriever.&nbsp; When it is called the association between
the ItemProxy and any G2 Item is cleared.&nbsp; In this state the ItemProxy
is not very useful.
<H3>
objectChanged(ObjectChangeEvent)</H3>
The objectChanged method takes an objectChanged event and modifies the
local copy of the value maintained for a named attribute.&nbsp; The
<H3>
upload()</H3>
The upload method sends the local copy of attribute values to be concluded
into the corresponding attributes of the associated G2 Item.
<H1>
<IMG SRC="item_retriever.gif" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32> ItemRetriever</H1>
The ItemRetriever component can lookup objects in a G2 process by class
and item name and forward the lookup results to ItemProxies.&nbsp; The
ItemRetriever plays two typical roles.&nbsp; One is to provide a means
of testing an item-editing dialog without needing to bring up a Telewindows2
client of one type or another.&nbsp; The other is to provide a simple means
of bootstrapping reference for simple client applications.
<H2>
Properties</H2>

<H3>
host</H3>
The host property defines the machine name of the desired G2 connection.&nbsp;
Note that when testing from the Telewindows2 ComponentEditor, this property
need not be specified.&nbsp; The host name provided when launching the
component editor will be used for all testing purposes as a convenience.
<H3>
itemClassName</H3>
The itemClassName property provides one half of a lookup key into a G2
server/host process for finding an item.
<H3>
itemName</H3>
The itemName property provides the other half of a lookup key into a G2
server/host process for finding an item.
<H3>
port</H3>
The port property defines the network listener port of the desired G2.&nbsp;
Note that when testing from the Telewindows2 ComponentEditor, this property
need not be specified.&nbsp; The port number provided when launching the
component editor will be used for all testing purposes as a convenience.
<H2>
Events</H2>

<H3>
itemRetrieved</H3>
The itemRetrieved event is fired when the retrieveItem method successfully
finds an item in G2.&nbsp; This event is typically used to invoke the itemRetrieved
method of an ItemProxy.
<H3>
itemRetrievedFailed</H3>
The itemRetrievedFailed event is fired when the retrieveItem method is
unsuccessful.
<H2>
Methods</H2>

<H3>
retrieveItem()</H3>
The retrieveItem method looks up an item in G2, based on the name and class
specified in the properties.&nbsp; It will establish a TwAccess connection
to G2 if one has not already been made from this client process.&nbsp;
If the retrieval finds a unique item for the given name and class it fires
an itemRetrieved event, else it fires an itemRetrievalFailed event.

<H2>
Properties</H2>

<H3>
attribute</H3>
The attribute holds the name of the item or structure attribute that this
text field represents.
<H3>
background</H3>
The background property holds the background color of this component.
<H3>
fieldType</H3>
The fieldType property indicates which G2 value type this component represents.&nbsp;
It will be used to format strings to present to users, and to parse input
from users.&nbsp; The supported types are:
<UL>
<LI>
Text</LI>

<LI>
Symbol</LI>

<LI>
Integer</LI>

<LI>
Float</LI>

<LI>
Quantity</LI>

<LI>
Sequence</LI>

<LI>
Structure</LI>

<LI>
BooleanTruthValue</LI>

<LI>
Value</LI>
</UL>
Fuzzy truth values are not supported, but may be in a future release.&nbsp;
G2 Item subclasses and the item-or-value type are not supported because
attributes containing Items are not editable as text in G2.

<P>font

<P>The font property controls the appearance of all text in the component.&nbsp;
Fonts vary by operating system, but will always include at least one each
of monospaced, serif, and san serif Latin character sets at a wide variety
of point sizes.
<H3>
foreground</H3>
The foreground property holds the background color of this component.
<H2>
Events</H2>

<H3>
objectChanged</H3>
The objectChanged event is sent whenever a value is changed by this component.&nbsp;
That could be when checkbox is checked or unchecked, a text field loses
keyboard focus, a new choice is made in a drop-down list, etcetera.
<H2>
Methods</H2>

<H3>
hide()</H3>
The hide method makes the component invisible.
<H3>
objectUpdated(ObjectUpdateEvent)</H3>
The objectUpdated method changes the value
<H3>
show()</H3>
The show method makes the component visible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H1>
<IMG SRC="g2textfield.gif" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32> G2TextField</H1>
The G2TextField is a normal, editable text field enhanced with the ability
to format, parse, and verify most G2 values.&nbsp; Verification happens
either character-by-character, or after keyboard focus leaves the textField.

<P>Please see&nbsp; <A HREF="#EditingControlCommonFeatures">Editing Contol
Common Features</A> for shared properties and methods.
<H2>
Properties</H2>

<H3>
defaultContents</H3>
The defaultContents is a string that will be used as input if no value
is received in this text field from an objectUpdated event.
<H3>
editable</H3>
The editable property indicates whether this text field can accept input.&nbsp;
The visual appearance of the field will change if this is the case.
<H3>
emptyFieldImpliesNull</H3>
The emptyFieldImpliesNull property is used to resolve the ambiguity between
an empty field indicating a empty string, or a null reference.&nbsp; Null
references are useful in editing G2 Items, because editing an attribute
to be null in Telewindows2 is equivalent to concluding that an attribute
"has no value" in the G2 Programming language.
<H3>
lowerLimit, upperLimit</H3>
The lowerLimit and upperLimit properties constrain the input values allowable,
if the field type is quantity, number, or float and the associated limitMode
property is configured.
<H3>
lowerLimitMode, upperLimitMode</H3>
The lowerLimitMode and upperLimitMode configure whether range bounds are
being enforced.&nbsp; They only take effect if the fieldType is quantitative.&nbsp;
The limit can be inclusive or exclusive, which is of particular utility
for integer fieldTypes.
<H3>
warnOnBadSyntax</H3>
The warnOnBadSyntax property controls whether a modal warning dialog is
generated upon input that does not match the field type and range limits
of this text field.&nbsp; Note that regardless of whether a warning is
issued, objectChanged events are not generated for input with syntax errors.
<H1>
<IMG SRC="g2dropdown.gif" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32> G2DropDownChoice</H1>
The G2DropDownChoice control allows users to select one of a fixed set
of choice of values.

<P>Please see&nbsp; <A HREF="#EditingControlCommonFeatures">Editing Contol
Common Features</A> for shared properties and methods.
<H2>
Properties</H2>

<H3>
choices</H3>
The choices property is a set of string representations of the values this
component may take.&nbsp; Choice string are interpreted by the fieldType
property of this component before being sent out in objectChanged events.
<H3>
defaultContents</H3>
The defaultContents property holds the string representation of the default
value of this component.&nbsp; It should be filled by one of the elements
of the choices property.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H1>
<IMG SRC="g2checkbox.gif" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32> G2Checkbox</H1>
The G2Checkbox allows the editing of boolean (non-fuzzy) truth-values.

<P>Please see&nbsp; <A HREF="#EditingControlCommonFeatures">Editing Contol
Common Features</A> for shared properties and methods.
<H2>
Properties</H2>

<H3>
label</H3>
The label property specifies a label to be placed adjacent to the checkbox.&nbsp;
Leave this property blank to have no label.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H1>
<IMG SRC="g2radiobutton.gif" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32>G2Radiobox</H1>
The G2Radiobox provides a visual alternative to the G2DropDownChoice for
choosing a value from an enumerated set.

<P>Please see&nbsp; <A HREF="#EditingControlCommonFeatures">Editing Contol
Common Features</A> for shared properties and methods.
<H2>
Properties</H2>

<H3>
columns</H3>
The columns property indicates how many columns in which to organize the
radio button choices.
<H3>
labels</H3>
The labels property should be filled by a set of strings that will label
the radio button choices.&nbsp; The number of labels should equal the number
of columns times rows.
<H3>
members</H3>
The members property should be filled with a set of strings that go in
one-to-one correspondence with the elements of the labels property.&nbsp;
These strings will be interpreted through the component's fieldType into
a G2 value when a selection occurs, and forward to connected components
through the objectChanged event.
<H3>
rows</H3>
The rows property indicates the number of rows in whcih to organize the
radio button choices.
