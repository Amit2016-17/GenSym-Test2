STEP1:
make sure the SpecialImpl has all the right code from the Impl you were developing with
NOTE: It modifying ItemSpecialImpl, make sure that DeferredStub gets
      all the methods that will be going into Item (i.e., all the new
      public methods from ItemSpecialImpl)

STEP2:
back up the Impl you were developing with

STEP3:
run:

java com.gensym.jgi.download.OverrideAnalyzer <source of overrides> <place to store overrides>

e.g.:
java com.gensym.jgi.download.OverrideAnalyzer ItemSpecialImpl.java Item.ovr

NOTE: the name of the place to store overrides must match the class name of the
relevant INTERFACE (e.g.: G2 Class ITEM maps to java interface com.gensym.classes.Item,
not com.gensym.classes.ItemImpl), because the StubClassLoader actually looks for
a .ovr file with the correct root name. 


STEP4:
Go to com.gensym.jgi.download.StubClassLoader, and change IS_BOOTSTRAPPING to true
(so that the StubClassLoader will generate system classes) and compile

DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THIS BACK
Or whenever you connect, all classes will get regenerated every time

STEP5:
run
java -Dcom.gensym.class.g2.repository=%SRCBOX%\java -Dcom.gensym.class.g2.package=com.gensym.classes com.gensym.jgi.download.DownloadInterfaces -stubs -host <host> -port <port> -classes <classes that need regeneration>

e.g.:
java -Dcom.gensym.class.g2.repository=%SRCBOX%\java -Dcom.gensym.class.g2.package=com.gensym.classes com.gensym.jgi.download.DownloadInterfaces -stubs -host weasel -port 1111 -classes ITEM MEDIA-BIN REMOTE-ITEM

Question: How do we know which classes need to be re-downloaded?
Answer: All those that contain code from the original version of the SpecialImpl you changed

If in doubt regenerate all (should actually be done with each major release of Javalink), 
using the batch file, generate-classes (which is in java/com/gensym/classes)

STEP6:
Check that the generated Impl and the interface have all the right stuff.
NOTE: The comments do not get put into the Impl (they only need to be in
the interface, since the Impl is not "documented".

STEP7:
CHANGE IS_BOOTSTRAPPING BACK TO  false
