= Remarks about these performance tests

Foremost, they are currently mostly dormant and, if used at all,
are used as regression tests.

In general, we lost any additional info about what each of
these KBs et al actually mean, what's so special about
them so that they can be used for performance testing.

WYSIWYG, or, IOW, look around and whatever you figure out,
good for you.

One very large KB, `all-pipesked-enbridge.kb` was removed from
here and copied to the S3 archive. Some other may face similar
destiny.
