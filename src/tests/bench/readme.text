G2 Benchmarks
- cpm, 10/31/95

This directory contains files used to run G2, GSI, and other benchmarks.  Note
that other files (e.g. basetime and GSI C files) are in other directories, as
described below.


Note that other benchmark-related information (spreadsheet results, reports,
charts, instructions, etc.) is currently stored on the development Macintosh
fileserver.


Running New Benchmarks:

When benchmarks are run on new platforms or new versions of G2, the results
should be stored in the benchmark spreadsheets (mentioned above).


Types of Benchmarks:

0. Benchmark Versions

Note that most of the benchmarks are organized by version of G2 or GSI
(exceptions are the basetime test).  Currently, these directories are:

  /bt/ab/tests/bench/bench-2-1
  /bt/ab/tests/bench/bench-3-0
  /bt/ab/tests/bench/bench-4-0
  /bt/ab/tests/bench/gsi-2-1
  /bt/ab/tests/bench/gsi-3-0
  /bt/ab/tests/bench/gsi-4-0

Also, note that the currently, main G2 benchmark, G2-BENCH.KB is located in
/bt/ab/tests and not in a /bt/ab/tests/bench subdirectory.

1. G2 Benchmark

The current, main G2 benchmark (benchmark of rules, procedure, actions, etc.)
is located in /bt/ab/tests/g2-bench.kb

If there are changes to the KB that prevent it from being backward compatible,
then an archive should be placed in the /bt/ab/tests/bench/bench-<version>.
Currently, there are archives in bench/bench-2-1 and bench-3-0.

Putting g2-bench.kb in this location was necessary so that the currently G2
benchmark is available in the same directory as the regression tests and so that
there is only one copy of this benchmark KB.

Note that g2-bench.kb is now modularized and requires ts-driver.kb.

2. GSI benchmarks
   /bt/ab/gsi/c/gsi_bench.c	- GSI 4.0 Benchmark bridge
   /bt/ab/ext/c/gsi_bench.c	- GSI 3.2 Benchmark bridge
   /bt/ab/ext/c/gsi_benchmark.c	- GSI pre-3.2 (3.0?) Benchmark bridge

   Note that the corresponding KB is in either:
   /bt/ab/tests/bench/gsi-3-0/
   /bt/ab/tests/bench/gsi-4-0/

   Note that the GSI benchmark bridges are now compiled as part of the G2/GSI
   builds.  See gsi/opt for the GSI 4.0 benchmark bridge executable.

3. Load/Save KB

4. Simulator

5. RPC (remote procedure calls) between two G2's

6. Basetime - C program, which measures machine speed.

   Benchmark C arithmetic operations and pointer following.
   Provides a measure of machine speed.
   Used in computing a "quality of port" measurement.

   See /bt/ab/ext/c/basetime.c and /bt/ab/ext/opt/basetime.

   Note that the basetime benchmark is now compiled as part of the G2
   builds.  The name of the executable is ext/opt/basetime.

7. basetime.lisp
   Benchmark Lisp arithmetic operations and pointer following.
   Provides a measure of machine speed.

8. sim-new.kb
   Simulator benchmark, modified generic-simulation-formulas.
   The results of sim-new.kb are currently *not used* in the benchmark reports.


Notes:

1. Note that the benchmark files originally lived on MA (a lispm).  These
  were moved off of MA on 3/30/94 and checked into the CVS sandbox.  The
  file names have changed to, in many cases, fit within an eight character file
  name limit (not counting the file extension).
   Also, note that some of these files have been removed from CVS and are now
  only accesible from the CVS "attic", if necessary.  These files have either
  been renamed or removed because the files are obsolete.  For example, there
  were several versions of the G2 benchmark KB, depending on what version of G2
  it ran in and whether it could run stand-alone.
