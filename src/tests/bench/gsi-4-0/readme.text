       gsi_bench.c (currently in gsi/c directory)


Note that the GSI 4.0 benchmark bridge, gsi_bench.c, is in the gsi/c/ directory
and is compiled as part of the builds in gsi/opt/.

Note that there are also GSI 3.2 benchmarks (gsi_bench.c) and GSI 3.0
benchmarks (gsi_benchmark.c) in ext/c and a copy in tests/bench/gsi-3-0/.
The GSI 3.2 benchmark is compiled, as part of builds, in ext/opt.

The following is a sample make-file for gsi_bench.  Note that the make file
dependencies for this benchmark will now be included in the AB make files for
GSI.
