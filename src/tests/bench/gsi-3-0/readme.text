GSI BENCHMARKS - VERSION 3.X
----------------------------
Note that there are two versions of the GSI 3.X benchmark:
1. gsi_bench.c     - 3.2 version (new GSI API)
2. gsi_benchmark.c - 3.0 version

Note that both of these files are already in the ext/c directory.
Both depend on gsi_regress_for_benchmark.c.

By default, The GSI 3.2 benchmark, gsi_bench.c, is compiled as part of builds.
Therefore, gsi_bench should be compiled during builds and placed in ext/opt.

Refer to the gsi/c directory and tests/bench/gsi-4-0 for the GSI 4.0 version
of the benchmark.

- cpm, 10/27/95
----------------------------
This directory contains the source files for the GSI benchmarks and the
necessary benchmark and GSI include (.h) files.

UNIX: There is a make file, makegsibench.make, for compiling on unix platforms.

VMS: There is a command file, compilebench.com, and options file, bench.opt, for
compiling with VAX VMS.  When running under VMS, first execute the second
command file, bench_symbol.com, that defines "gsibench" to start the GSI
extension and to pass any command line arguments.

NOTE: The GSI-BENCHMARKS-3-0-VAX.KB is used on slower platforms, such as some of
the VAXes, in place of the gsi-benchmarks-3-0.kb.  This is necessary because
some of the Get-Value and Set-Value Througput tests do not complete otherwise.

Directories:
  VAX files on UNIX vmsdisc:
    /vmsdisc/public/benchmarks/bench-3-0/gsi-bench/
  VAX files on VMS machine (same directory as above)
    vmsdisc:[public.benchmarks.bench-3-0.gsi-bench]

  On SPITFR, a Vax 4100/60, not currently on the cluster:
    g230$dir:[.benchmarks]
    Copy from the VMSDISC to this directory as necessary using, for example:
       $ COPY bolton""::vmsdisc:[public.benchmarks.bench-3-0.gsi-bench]bench.exe []
  KBS are on the cluster in the following directory.  Copy from "tests/bench>"
  as needed.
    acton$dua0:[ab.benchmarks]
