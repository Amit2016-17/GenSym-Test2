This contains the definitions for Gensym custom dialogs for install shield.

This project was made by following instructions found in the web page
http://support.installshield.com/kb/view.asp?articleid=Q104953
The initial files were found in the InstallShield directory
C:\Program Files\InstallShield\InstallShield Professional 6.2\Examples\Custom Dialog\VC++ 6 Project

There are two dialogs used:

A modification of SD_NDLG_REGISTERUSEREX, in which we changed the word "serial
number" to "license key"

A modification of SD_NDLG_SETUPTYPE, in which we hide the "compact" setup type.
Another note on the web,
http://www.nathanpralle.com/writings/installshield_custom_dialogs.html,
suggested not *deleting* the unnecessary controls, but merely marking them
"invisible".  This makes developing the dialog kind of ugly, unfortunately, but
he says bad things may occur otherwise.

compile.bat will compile the dll, if SRCBOX is set properly.  Or, load up the
_IsUser.dsw file to VC++ and build it with the IDE.

Note: the thing I found missing from the first web page that you should renumber
the dialog, but then you also need to give it a name (after step nine, pasting
into the _IsUser resources pane).  I ended up first giving it a new number, and
compiling, and THEN giving it a name.  Nothing got #defined without a name, but
if I gave it a name before a new number then it #defined as the old number.
This was very confusing and seemed like it must be wrong.
