In the event that Gensym fails to correct a material, documented, reproducible defect within a reasonable period, Gensym may, in Gensym's discretion, replace the defective NetSleuth software, or refund to Licensee the amount that Licensee paid Gensym for the defective NetSleuth software and cancel this agreement and the licenses granted herein. In such event, Licensee agrees to return to Gensym all copies of the Software.
