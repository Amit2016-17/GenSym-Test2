Instructions for Generating Keys for the G2 Bundle
--------------------------------------------------

GENSYM CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION: This information is exclusively for use of
Gensym Order and Licensing Persons with a need to know only.

The current license key generator is basic, but does the job simply and easily.
After logging in, the user simply types Y, N, and some numbers a few times to
obtain the license key.

Telnet to Remote Host BOON.  From Internet Explorer, choose File -> Open, then
type this in: TELNET://BOON

This brings up a "Telnet Window" in which all the interaction will take place.

At the prompt enter user name fyang, password gensym.

Follow the prompts to choose the operating system, bundle type (G2 Development
vs. Deployment), and which bridges.  When done, it prints out the license key,
which can be copied and pasted.  It then allows you to either generate another
key (by typing Y at the prompt), or to log out (by typing N).

After logging out, the Telnet window can be closed, or reconnected by choosing
Connect -> Remote System from its menu.

Shown below is a log of a sample interaction in the Telnet window to generate
two license keys: first an Integrity family license, and second a G2 family
license.
