This example demonstrates how to use a non-default location for
Telewindows.  You might want to specify this for a number of reasons;
for example, to test with different versions of Telewindows.<P>

<!-- Begin TW code -->
<!-- Users must have the Telewindows ActiveX Control installed on their machine
     for the following to work.  You received a cabinet file, TwControl.cab,
     with G2, which will allow users' browsers to automatically download and
     install the control.  To accomplish this, you need to install the cabinet
     file on your intranet web server, and modify the example URL shown below
     to reflect the location where you installed it.

<OBJECT CLASSID="clsid:EC99E4EE-F5F1-4323-9829-06E9B0AFB934"
        ID=WorkstationView HEIGHT=500 WIDTH=700 HSPACE=85
        codebase="http://download.example.com/gensym/TwControl.cab#Version=8,3,128,1">
</OBJECT>
<br><a href="diag-exe.html"><i>If you don't see G2 running, click here.</i></a>

<SCRIPT LANGUAGE=VBScript>
WorkstationView.TwLocation = "c:\tw-83r1\tw.exe"
WorkstationView.LaunchBackground = "wheat"
WorkstationView.ConnectToG2()
</SCRIPT>
<!-- End TW code -->

<P>Notes/requirements:

<ul>

<li>In this example, the Telewindows ActiveX control connects to host
"<b>localhost</b>" at TCP/IP port <b>1111</b>.  Before running this
example, you should run G2 on the same computer as your browser.  Make
sure G2 uses port 1111. You can see which port is being used by
running the command <i>Main Menu</i> -> <i>Miscellany</i> ->
<i>Network Info</i>.  Alternatively, change the host and port settings
specified in the VB Script code in this HTML document so that they
specify the desired G2 host and port.

<li>No particular KB is required or expected for this example.

<li>Here is the VB Script code used for this example:<br>
  <pre>
  &lt;OBJECT CLASSID="clsid:EC99E4EE-F5F1-4323-9829-06E9B0AFB934"
          ID=WorkstationView HEIGHT=500 WIDTH=700 HSPACE=85
          codebase="http://download.example.com/gensym/TwControl.cab#Version=8,3,128,1">
  &lt;/OBJECT>
  &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=VBScript>
  <b>WorkstationView.TwLocation = "c:\tw-83r1\tw.exe"</b>
  WorkstationView.LaunchBackground = "wheat"
  WorkstationView.ConnectToG2()
  &lt;/SCRIPT></pre>

Notice that the <b><i>WorkstationView.TwLocation</i></b> property is
set to "<b>c:\tw-83r1\tw.exe</b>". Normally you use the Telewindows
executable (tw.exe) that is included with the TwControl.cab file that
gets downloaded the first time the control is used.  This tw.exe file
gets installed a location where Internet Explorer can automatically
find it. Using the TwLocation property instructs the control to use a
different tw.exe.  This tw.exe must reside on a drive mounted on the
same computer as the browser being used.  If there is no tw.exe at the
location specified, e.g., in this example "c:\tw-83r1\tw.exe", the
user will see an error message saying the system cannot find the path
specified.

<li>This example uses ActiveX, and therefore needs to run on
Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser.

<li>The Telewindows ActiveX Control in this example is specified as being
downloadable via the Internet from a fictitious HTTP server.  If you change the
example to reflect a location where the cab file can be downloaded, there may be
a noticeable delay for the Internet Explorer browser to connect to the server
the first time the Telewindows ActiveX Control is used.  After the choice is
confirmed to download and install the control, an additional delay will occur
while the control is downloaded and installed.
