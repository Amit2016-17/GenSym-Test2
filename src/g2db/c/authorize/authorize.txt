
ENABLING BRIDGE PRODUCTS WITH GENSYM AUTHORIZATION FUNCTIONALITY

Courtesy of Bob Franceschini since no one else bothered to write it down
anywhere and since no 1 person has all the information.

You must do the following in order to utilize the authorization stuff for 
bridges:

Symbols:
--------------------------------------
GSI_ROOT     - define to a directory location containing the gsi.ok file
   (Note: an easy way to define symbols under NT is to open the 'control panel' and
    choose 'system'. At the bottom it lets you define symbols available at startup)

Pre-Processor Definitions:
--------------------------------------
WIN32        - for nsleep.obj  (should be set automatically) 
MSDOS        - for gsi_brg.obj


Link Libraries & Objects
--------------------------------------
nsleep.obj   - gets ethernet card address and/or hardware key address
gsi_brg.obj  - performs authorization check (stage1,stage2,periodic)
wsock32.lib  - for ICP socket routines
advapi32.lib - ??? you probably don't need this but they say we do
netapi32.lib - since nsleep uses Netbios calls     
spromeps.lib - for hardware key  


Note: Hardware keys are available though P & L. The nsleep software first
      searches for the hardware key and then the ethernet address (on NT).
      For Windows DOS, I think that only hardware keys are supported.
